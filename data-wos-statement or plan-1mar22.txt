TI Writing a Diversity and Inclusivity Statement Guidelines for Nursing

DE diversity; diversity and inclusivity statement; inclusivity; nursing
   program
AB Background: For decades, nursing programs have worked to address the need for a culturally diverse workforce and student body to better reflect the populations they serve. The development of a diversity and inclusivity statement is a first step in ameliorating this issue.
   Problem: A clearly communicated diversity and inclusivity statement should demonstrate a nursing organization's commitment to the value of people from all backgrounds. It should include language that emphasizes the value of diverse cultures, experiences, thoughts, and contributions.
   Approach: Nursing faculty can benefit from an organized and literature-supported model for writing meaningful diversity and inclusivity statements.
   Conclusions: Such an approach will communicate a nursing program's commitment to diversity and inclusion in the organization's mission, policies, practices, relationships, and curricula. This article provides nursing faculty with evidence-supported guidelines for writing meaningful diversity, inclusion, and equity statements for their nursing programs.

TI THE DIVERSITY BARGAIN AND THE DISCOURSE DANCE OF EQUITABLE AND BEST
SO PHILOSOPHY OF MUSIC EDUCATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE diversity; equity; policy; politics
ID UNITED-STATES
AB Contemporary music education leaders suggest ambiguous definitions of "diversity," often assuming it both unquestionably good and compatible with equity. The purpose of this inquiry is to explore the assumptions underlying such discourse. First, I use the legal history of diversity in education to examine the American National Association for Music Education's statements on equity, access, inclusivity, and diversity. Second, drawing on Thomas Green's educational systems framework, I analyze the political strength of arguments surrounding diversity and equity. Third, considering instances when white parents deem diversity "best" for their children, I investigate the advantages and limitations of what Natasha Warikoo calls the "diversity bargain." While not condoning unbridled self-interest, I posit how music educators might use parents' self-interest to support more ethical practices. Designed to benefit all students, diversity initiatives conflict with efforts aimed at equity. Music education diversity and equity rhetoric rely on either a troubling misreading of a politically strong state rationale or on the weak political positions of societal interests or educational goods valuable for their own sake. Rather than focusing on diverse content, teachers and students might experiment with how artistic expressions enable the exchange of individuals' stories and insights. The music education profession might also provide attention to equity apart from diversity.

AB Framed by theories and methods from critical discourse analysis and social semiotics, this comparative case study of six Missouri school systems asked: How do school districts represent and address their changing communities? Discourses of equity, language, identity, and demographic change were examined across school system websites, mission statements, and policies. Analyses showed that all cases except for one White rural district highlighted the value of diversity through their mission statements, homepage photos, and hyperlinks to policies and resources for changing communities. However, four districts also presented deficit perspectives about racially, culturally, and linguistically minoritized students and highlighted neoliberal educational reform values of marketable competitiveness and accountability. Only one highlighted social equity and inclusivity. Deeper analyses focused on three cases demonstrate how competing discourses reflect ideological debates in education, which can shape community engagement and perceptions of students.

DE School psychology; diversity; equity; inclusion; social justice
ID HISTORICALLY BLACK-COLLEGES; SOCIAL-JUSTICE; STUDENTS; VIEWS
AB Individually and collectively, it is now more important than ever that we engage in intentional and sustained action to advocate for and advance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the field of school psychology. To create positive change and the momentum to sustain it, it is essential that school psychology colleagues, organizations, and entities-including journals-identify how each can contribute to advancing DEI efforts. Herein, the School Psychology Review leadership team offers a brief summary of several of our intentional efforts, to date, to advocate for and advance DEI in school psychology scholarship. These actions toward accountability include (a) establishing individual and collective commitments to advocating for and advancing DEI as the foundation of our scholarship; (b) diversifying the journal leadership; (c) diversifying the editorial advisory board; (d) preparing future diverse journal leadership through mentored editorial fellowship programs, especially focused on early research career individuals; (e) mentoring future colleagues by establishing a student editorial board with members from diverse backgrounds; (f) focusing on special topics relevant to diverse and minoritized children, youth, families, and school communities; (g) making available professional-development opportunities and resources; and (h) establishing a journal action plan focused on advancing DEI. All colleagues, organizations, and entities are invited to individually and collectively join us to Be the Change in advancing and sustaining DEI efforts in school psychology scholarship.
   IMPACT STATEMENT
   The School Psychology Review leadership team outlines actions to advocate for and advance diversity, equity, and inclusivity in school psychology scholarship. Actions and accountability discussed include: establishing individual and collective commitments; diversifying the journal leadership, as well as the editorial advisory board; establishing journal infrastructures to support further development and contributions of diverse students and early career colleagues; and establishing a journal action plan focused on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.

AB Background: The aim of this review is to identify factors that impact the academic success of African American nursing students in prelicensure nursing education programs, given the need for RN health care workers to be more reflective of the general U.S. population. Method: A literature review was conducted to integrate the findings of the research related to African American nursing students in entry-level nursing programs to identify perceived barriers and supports to their retention and graduation. Results: The review revealed alienation, isolation, and being different as barriers to success. Academic support, mentoring, and integration and inclusivity were factors that helped promote success. Conclusion: Recommendations for the establishment of diversity and inclusivity plans, structured enrichment and academic support services, mentorship, and activities that fostered student engagement and integration were actions that could contribute to the academic success of African American nursing students.

AB While SAGES prides itself on diversity and inclusivity, we also recognize that as an organization we are not impervious to blind spots impacting equity within the membership. To address this, the We R Sages task force was formed to identify the barriers and facilitators to creating a diverse organization and develop a strategic plan for the implementation of programing and opportunities that promote diversity and inclusivity within our membership. As the first step in the process, a survey was administered to gauge the current organizational climate.
   In September of 2017, a validated climate survey was administered to 704 SAGES committee members via SurveyMonkeyA (R). Climate was assessed on: overall SAGES experience, consideration of leaving the organization, mentorship within the organization, resources and opportunities within the organization, and attitudes and experiences within the organization. Additional free text responses were encouraged to generate qualitative themes.
   The survey response rate was 52.1% (n = 367). Respondent self-identified demographics were: male (73%), white (63%), heterosexual (95.5%), and non-disabled (98%). Average overall satisfaction was 8.1/10. 12.5% of respondents had considered leaving the organization and 74.4% had not identified a formal mentor within the organization. Average agreement with equitable distribution of resources and opportunities was 5.8/10. 93.6% of respondents had not experienced bias within the organization.
   Overall SAGES has a very positive climate; however, several key issues were identified from the quantitative survey as well as the free text responses. Strategic planning to address issues of membership recruitment, committee engagement, advancement transparency, diversity awareness, leadership development, and formal mentorship are being implemented.

LA English
DT Article
DE diversity; equity; ethnicity; inclusion; microaggressions; race; racism
AB Problem, research strategy, and findings
   African American/Black and Hispanic/Latin/o/a/x practitioners are underrepresented in the planning profession. In this study we examine these practitioners' experience with the climate for diversity in their workplaces. Drawing from a survey of 3,005 APA members, we show that African American/Black and Hispanic/Latin/o/a/x practitioners experience significantly higher rates of bias and discrimination than other groups. Interviews with 24 African American/Black and Hispanic/Latin/o/a/x planners across the United States reinforce the narrative that these racial and ethnic groups working in the planning field continue to face racism, discrimination, and microaggressions in the workplace, which affects the impact of their work in planning practice.
   Takeaway for practice
   Given the potential negative consequences of the lack of diversity and inclusion at work along with the presence of discrimination/microaggressions, our study shows that it is necessary not only to increase diversity in the workplace but also to create inclusive work environments. Practicing planners concluded that cross-cultural communication and antiracist training can help planners to plan with ethnically and racially diverse communities and practice inclusivity, both in the workplace among their colleagues and in communities of difference. But trainings will not be enough; for substantial change to occur, major shifts are needed in the profession as a whole, including in APA and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning (ACSP).

AB Background: Disparities in diversity, equity and inclusivity are endemic in American society, and in the United States (US) healthcare system. As US population diversity increases, physical therapists (PTs) must be able to provide equitable care for all people, regardless of their cultural or personal identity. Culturally-humble Hospice and palliative Care (HPC) PT practice, with vigilant awareness of cultural complexities and commitment to approaching cultural understanding with humility, is essential to provide optimal end of life care for all persons.
   Purpose: This Perspective paper will 1) provide an overview of the role of PT in HPC, 2) describe culturally-related disparities in HPC, and 3) suggest evidence-based strategies for cultural humility in HPC PT best practice. Specific challenges in the delivery of culturally-humble end of life care will be discussed, including advanced care planning, truth telling, and death beliefs/practices.

AB Among different types of land use, public open space (POS) is noted as one of the most important assets for a city and local community, which benefits people in terms of their social, physical, and psychological well-being. However, the existing literature has revealed the uneven distribution of POS across different social contexts, which has failed to serve potential users equitably. While there is a significant need for research on the integration of the physical environment and the right to POS, previous studies have failed to show how to best merge these two components to promote equitable use of POS. Focusing on spatial justice as the theoretical basis for planning and assessment of POS, this paper aims to propose a framework for the evaluation of spatial justice performance in POS. We review key theories of spatial justice, and critically evaluate the insights they share when applied to urban POS planning. We examine the issues related to spatial justice of POS from three aspects namely: physical justice; urbanization of social justice; and right to the city, in order to identify the key variables of POS spatial justice. These examinations are supported by the analysed results of opinions from experts collected through both interviews and questionnaires. A conceptual framework for POS spatial justice evaluation is thus developed, which includes five constructs: Access and Management, Sociability and Diversity, Demand and Provision, Social Stratum and Information, and Social Inclusion. The relational interactions among these constructs provide an in-depth understanding and guidance for future work on POS planning, which contribute to bridging the knowledge gap on the subject.

DE social justice; diverse students; equity; inclusion
ID SOCIAL-JUSTICE; SPECIAL-EDUCATION; CHILDRENS RIGHTS
AB The field of school psychology continues to further embrace a social justice perspective to address systemic racism, privilege, prejudice, and discrimination. To accomplish this mission, school psychologists must ensure that there is a solid literature base that is inclusive and representative of students from minoritized backgrounds. A review of student sociodemographic characteristics was conducted of all articles in four of the primary journals of school psychology from 2010 to 2019 (n = 1,213 articles). Compared to national estimates of school-age sociodemographic distributions, researchers tended to include samples more representative of students identifying as White/Caucasian and underrepresentative of students from low-income backgrounds. Authors rarely included or described participants' sexual orientations and gender identities beyond the binary (female/male). We provide a discussion and recommendations for improving the inclusivity of students from minoritized backgrounds in future school psychology research.
   Impact Statement
   To provide evidence-based school psychological practices to all students, the field's literature must be representative of the student population. In reviewing the past decade of school psychology research, the literature tends to overrepresent students who are White and come from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds. There tends to be underrepresentation of sexual minority youth, youth from low SES backgrounds, and children at the elementary grade level.

AB In this one-day workshop, we aim to bring together a community of researchers at the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference who will share how they already make or plan to make equity-promoting fairness by allocating more resources and opportunities to those who need it- and inclusivity-the inclusion and meaningful participation of people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized-foundational to their research with children and families. By discussing theoretical and practice-based approaches, providing feedback on each other's research, and collectively identifying concerns and challenges in addressing equity and inclusivity when doing and assessing research in IDC, we intend to do twofold. First, we will build our understanding of how our approaches, designs, and/or methods may either be restricting or facilitating equitable access and participation of diverse children and their families. Second, we will work to establish and articulate approaches to our research that forefront equity and inclusivity, taking into account how intersecting identities affect how the children and families with whom we work have or do not have access to various sources of power.

AB In December 2017, Clemson University's administration via the Assistant Vice President for Strategic Diversity Leadership charged each college and the University Libraries with creating and implementing a diversity strategic plan to align with the ClemsonForward institutional strategic plan and assessment system. Clemson University Libraries answered this charge by creating a Libraries Diversity Plan Working Group (LDPWG), which applied a provided institutional framework to conduct an inventory of current diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and obtain input, feedback, and support from all the Libraries' faculty and staff as well as the organization and institution administration to create an ambitious diversity strategic plan. The LDPWG worked for sixteen months to create an updated organization mission statement, a sustainable diversity statement, and an accountable roadmap, furthering Clemson University Libraries' DEI initiatives and impact regarding six strategic priority areas: climate and infrastructure, recruitment and retention, education and training, research and scholarship, leadership support and development, and strategic partnerships.

For Extension professionals to capitalize on the Horizon Report recommendations, we must embrace the report's call to action while also having an action plan for diversity and inclusivity. The challenge for Extension professionals goes beyond capitalizing on new technology trends; it has a broad scope and necessitates our considering critical issues surrounding those trends.

AB The lack of racial diversity, equity, and inclusion in leadership positions is an ongoing issue in intercollegiate athletics. The purpose of this study was to analyze the mission, vision, and diversity, equity, and inclusion statements of Power 5 athletic departments and their affiliated universities regarding racial diversity and inclusion to better understand how these two stakeholders work in unison or isolation when creating racially diverse environments. The authors utilized an innovative lens, which merges critical race theory with institutional theory to center race and racism while evaluating how these institutional logics interact in practice. The data show that Power 5 institutions maintain a lack of racial diversity through cultures and mission statements that omit diverse values, create symbolic statements, or lack meaning in creating a diverse reality.

AB Problem, research strategy and findings Municipal arts and cultural plans direct significant amounts of public investment and set far-reaching policies, as arts and culture investment becomes an increasingly widespread economic development strategy. Though these plans frequently advertise the city's diversity, they often lack specific strategies for supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In addition, the creation of these plans often does not involve urban planners, nor do the plans often connect to the city's comprehensive plan or contain the types of fact bases and commitments to equity that comprehensive plans do. In this study of 64 U.S. municipal arts and cultural plans, we investigated what kinds of cities are producing arts and cultural plans that do a better job of integrating concepts of DEI and what factors can explain these differences. We also investigated which specific policies were present that addressed DEI in arts and cultural plans. We found that newer plans more strongly emphasized equity, and plans with more robust public processes and those in more diverse cities more strongly emphasized equity and DEI overall, whereas plans in cities with lower median household incomes more strongly emphasized equity and inclusion. Overall, plans were much more likely to talk about diversity and inclusion than the specifics of equitable distribution of arts and cultural resources. Takeaway for practice Planners need to get involved in arts and cultural planning to ensure that planning processes for arts and cultural plans work to achieve the same standards we expect for comprehensive plans. They must be based on inclusive processes, understand the range of diversity of people in the city, and commit to specific, targeted place-based and people-based public investment to improve equity. Planners can also expand their typical approaches through alignments with topical arts and cultural plans.

ID MISSION STATEMENTS; TRENDS
AB Post-secondary education in the 21st century United States is rapidly diversifying, and institutions' online offerings and presence are increasingly significant. Academic libraries have an established history of offering virtual services and providing online resources for students, faculty, staff, and the general public. In addition to these services and resources, information on academic library websites can contribute to an institution's demonstration of value placed on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). This article analyzes the DEI statements of a library consortium's member websites to explore how these statements contribute to institutional construction of, and commitment to, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Descriptive analysis revealed 12 of 16 member libraries had explicitly labeled DEI statements in November 2020, with an additional member updating their website to include such a statement in early 2021. Content analysis examined how the existing statements contributed to institutional value of and commitment to DEI, and multi-modal theory explored the communicative aspects of DEI statement content. Analysis revealed vague conceptualizations of diversity and library-centered language in DEI statements, while a subset of statements employed anti-racist and social justice language to position the library as an active agent for social change. Implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB Researchers conducted a qualitative content analysis to investigate the observable involvement of 22 Governing Boards with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts at colleges and universities. Using a merged theoretical framework of Rall et al.'s (Journal of Education Human Resources 38:139-164, 2020) Culturally Sustaining Governance and LePeau's (The Review of Higher Education 39:97-122, 2015) Cycle of Making Continuous Commitments to Diversity and Inclusion, the findings revealed that Boards act in similar ways to an electrical socket between internal and external stakeholders associated with DEI efforts. Boards receive information from stakeholders at points in time and episodically 'plug in' to DEI efforts such as endorsing policies or diversity plans. The study highlights the nature and potential of governance partnerships to advance DEI work. Implications encourage Boards to enhance their capacity to partner and support organizational change.

AB BackgroundMany organizations have prioritized health equity and the social determinants of health (SDoH). These organizations need information to inform their planning, but, relatively few quantifiable measures exist. This study was conducted as an environmental scan to inform the American Academy of Family Physician's (AAFP's) health equity strategy. The objectives of the study were to identify and prioritize a comprehensive list of strategies in four focus areas: health equity leadership, policy, research, and diversity.MethodsA Delphi study was used to identify and prioritize the most important strategies for reducing health inequities among the four aforementioned focus areas. Health equity experts were purposefully sampled. Data were collected in three rounds for each focus area separately. A comprehensive list of strategy statements was identified for each focus area in round one. The strategy statements were prioritized in round two and reprioritized in a final third round. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated for the final analysis.ResultsFifty strategies were identified across the four focus areas. Commitment to health equity, knowledge of health inequities, and knowledge of effective strategies to address the drivers of health inequities were ranked the highest for leadership. Universal access to health care and health in all policies were ranked highest for policy. Multi-level interventions, the effect of policy, governance, and politics, and translating and disseminating health equity interventions into practice were ranked the highest for research. Providing financial support to students from minority or low-socioeconomic backgrounds, commitment from undergraduate and medical school leadership for educational equity, providing opportunities for students from minority or low-socioeconomic backgrounds to prepare for standardized tests, and equitable primary and secondary school funding were ranked highest for diversity.ConclusionsThe AAFP and other medical specialty societies have an important opportunity to advance health equity. They should develop a health equity policy agenda, equip physicians and other stakeholders, use their connections with practice-based research networks to identify and translate practical solutions to address the SDoH, and advocate for a more diverse medical workforce.Trial registrationNot applicable.

DE Diversity; Equity; Inclusion; Gender; Ethnicity; Discrimination
AB Structural prejudices and unconscious biases within the construction industry have negatively impacted the construction workforce. Workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion are major concerns in the construction industry. The goal of the present study is to enable the assessment of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry by identifying and determining the level of influence of applicable indicators revealing diversity, equity, and inclusion at the workforce level. A two-round survey and a panel of 16 experts were utilized to achieve the research goal. After collecting and analyzing the responses, 10 indicators were found to be influential in terms of achieving a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment and were therefore considered measures of workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion. These indicators are (1) ethnic and racial diversity at the company level; (2) gender diversity and inclusion at the workforce level; (3) a corporate policy statement on diversity and inclusion; (4) gender/ethnic diversity in leadership/management positions; (5) knowledge and skill diversity; (6) equitable pay/compensation at the industry level; (7) equality, social justice, and nondiscrimination policy statement; (8) pay structure transparency; (9) equitable pay/compensation at the company level; and (10) merit-based transparent recruitment and promotion. The present study contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a means of assessing workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion in the construction industry. It is expected that utilizing the identified indicators would help managers and human resources specialists/professionals in construction perform a thorough assessment of the level of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness of the workforce within their organizations and identify opportunities for enhancing the workforce diversity, equity, and inclusiveness.

ID WIDENING PARTICIPATION; UNIVERSITY; DISCOURSE; DIVERSITY; EQUALITY
AB There is a strong rationale for people seeking asylum and refugees given temporary protection to be key beneficiaries of Australian higher education equity practices. However, despite the extreme precarity they face, this group remains among the most educationally disadvantaged populations in Australia. Here, we use critical discourse analysis to examine the publicly available statements of 38 Australian universities to identify discursive representations of equity practices and connections, with our analytic gaze focused through the lens of people seeking asylum. Using a three-part analytic heuristic examining 'statements', 'practices' and 'connections', we offer a critical discourse analysis of how each public university expresses its commitment to the equity agenda in powerful stakeholder-facing documents-such as annual reports, strategic plans and media releases-and we compare this analysis against institutional stated practices with regard to people seeking asylum. In identifying misalignments between equity statements and stated practices, we suggest that institutional equity narratives articulate 'imagined worlds', in which all marginalised groups can access higher education. We argue that now is the time to move beyond these 'imagined worlds', to enact stated commitments to universal education, by instituting real and effective practices to facilitate equitable access to Australian higher education for people seeking asylum.

AB Existing but limited empirical research suggests that while inclusivity, equity and justice are centrally important to building resilience, City governments do not consistently prioritize equity in resultant plans. Hence, more research is needed to unearth pathways toward equitable resilience planning. The goal of this paper is to contribute to this empirical gap, asking whether and how principles of justice have been incorporated in in-situ resilience planning. We explore a case study from one participating City in the "100 Resilient Cities" (100RC) program, Toronto. Using key informant interviews and document analysis, we examine how Toronto addressed equity and inclusion throughout the "ResilientTO" public engagement process. We find that Toronto's Resilient Conversations approach supports the notion that programs that treat resilience as a process of negotiation rather than a discrete outcome can help to advance procedural justice. We analyze the benefits and limitations to applying the theory of negotiated resilience in relation to common criticisms of collaborative planning. We find that certain bureaucratic norms, such as a tendency toward project-based planning and consultation, impede the transformative potential of negotiated resilience in practice. The findings of this research can inform more procedurally just strategic planning processes in North American cities.

AB Diversity, equity, and inclusion are increasingly referenced as goals in general or master plans, yet we know little about how these concepts shape topical arts and cultural plans, which have become an important facet of economic development strategies. Through a detailed content analysis of 64 municipal arts and cultural plans in the United States, this project sought to find out how and when such plans integrate concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We found that these values are only occasionally guiding principles and that most plans are written from the perspective of the majority (usually White) with very little information about demographic or socioeconomic context. Many talk about being inclusive or diverse without ever identifying the marginalized or low-resourced groups in the community. The plans we evaluated span a 20-year time period; those from 2016 to 2019 demonstrate a much stronger equity focus in the planning process and strategy content.

AB In this Viewpoint, I urge public planners to examine how planning departments' internal rules and norms reproduce racial inequity. I first explain how public planning departments' inner workings are racialized and then offer racial equity in planning organizations (REPO) as a framework and directive to align public planning racial equity goals with internal rules and norms. I argue that organizational change will position planners to advance racial equity in the United States. REPO can lead to local change and recalibrate how planners envision their role in changing their communities.

AOTA affirms the inalienable right of every individual to feel welcomed, valued, a sense of belonging, and respected while accessing and participating in society, regardless of the internal or external factors that make every individual unique. This statement supports efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion within all aspects of occupational therapy, including practice, education, and research, as well as policy development and advocacy.

AB Several authors have written about the disparity between our values statements concerning gender equity and diversity and the behavior of our professional organizations. In this article, I argue that this is a predictable by-product of our collective cultural learning histories, that we have access to the variables that must be manipulated to alter this behavioral trajectory, and that now is the time to apply the principles of behavior toward changing our current repertoire. As a case in point, I provide evidence regarding the current state of the efforts within psychology and behavior analysis to ensure gender equity, and end with a series of recommendations for institutions and individual leaders to enact toward the presumably valued outcomes of equity and, more broadly speaking, diversity.

AB In light of the Black Lives Matter movement, the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) community has had to reflect on how their organizations can address their disparities in identity representation. To that end, the ACS Committee on Minority Affairs (CMA) has been called upon to advise various levels of the chemistry enterprise in their interventions, such as structured and actionable policy statements. As a result, this work was created to provide a model for all organizations to write catalytic diversity, inclusion, respect, and equity (DIRE) policy statements. The model herein acknowledges active tensions and leverages theory, analysis, and practical experiences in an eight-sentence structure completed in four steps. It also provides criteria for evaluating and updating existing statements.

TI Cities and diversity - Should we want it? Can we plan for it?
SO URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE just city; urban planning; diversity; capacities
AB Diversity has become the new orthodoxy of city planning. The term has several meanings: a varied physical design, mixes of uses, an expanded public realm, and multiple social groupings exercising their "right to the city." Its impetus lies in the postinodernist/poststructuralist critique of modernism's master narratives and more specifically in reactions to the urban landscape created by segregation, urban renewal, massive housing projects, and highway building programs. Privileging diversity raises significant issues. Can planned environments produce diversity or only a "staged authenticity"? Does emphasizing diversity obscure the economic structure? Is there a connection between diversity and economic innovation? Does social diversity necessarily contribute to equity and a broadly satisfying public realm? Rather than setting diversity as the principal goal of city planning, I argue for the model of the just city, based on Nussbaum's concept of capacities and a recognition of the inevitable trade-offs among equity, diversity, growth, and sustainability.

   Success: A Case Study of North Carolina Community College Strategic
   Plans
SO COMMUNITY COLLEGE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID STATEMENTS; MISSION
AB Strategic plans are valuable tools for colleges seeking to cast vision and provide focused guidance for leadership and faculty, but it is not clear how these plans address student success. This study analyzed plans from 55 of the 58 community colleges in North Carolina. First, we analyzed the plans using a 10-step strategic planning framework to determine how well each aligned with this planning process. Then, we analyzed the plans to see how they aligned with a framework for student success that includes four elements: completion, learning, labor market outcomes and equity. Additionally, we examined the plans with an interest in understanding how they reflected the influence of neoliberalism ideals. We found that all 55 strategic plans identified goals, and most of the plans also provided strategies corresponding with these goals. Less attention, however, was given to implementation. A close look at the identified goals within the plans highlighted predominance of labor market objectives (36%), followed by attention to transfer/completion (31%) and learning (25%), with minimal attention to equity (9%), which suggests that neoliberal ideals - that gauge success by accountability measures of completion - have placed pressure on colleges in the strategic planning process. Our document analysis suggests that community college leaders are missing an opportunity to leverage the strategic planning process to support organizational learning and change by not focusing campus attention on shared goals prioritizing student success and advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Neglecting to provide publicly-available planning documents also misses the benefit of stakeholder engagement.

TI Promises and Pitfalls of Diversity Statements: Proceed With Caution
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID COLOR-BLINDNESS; GENDER BIAS; INTERVENTIONS; EXPRESSION; FACULTY; WOMEN;
   RACE
AB As part of their efforts to increase the diversity of their workforce and student body, medical schools, academic medical centers, and individual departments are increasingly crafting public statements about their value for and commitment to diversity. For these statements to effectively enhance diversity, however, care must be taken, as research shows that some diversity-related messages can backfire. To avoid the pitfalls and realize the promise of diversity statements, this article presents recommendations based on experimental studies that investigate the impact of diversity messages. These studies suggest that diversity statements be aspirational, emphasize autonomy, and express a value for difference. Aspirational statements avoid creating the impression that equity has been achieved, thus preventing the "illusion of fairness" and the "paradox of meritocracy," wherein espousing egalitarian values and the existence of a meritocracy can increase biased outcomes and workplace disparities. Statements that emphasize autonomy avoid the backlash that can occur when organizational members feel coerced into adopting prodiversity actions. Statements that emphasize the value of human differences convey a multicultural message that has shown positive outcomes compared with "colorblind" statements that acknowledge our common humanity. Although there are no studies specific to academic medicine, current research on a variety of organizations, including some studies from the health care industry, suggests that relying on these recommendations to craft a diversity statement may help contribute to academic medical centers' larger efforts to promote diversity and inclusion and may help them avoid some deleterious effects.

AB Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) in the workplace are essential to the success of a functioning observatory. The current climate among astronomical institutions with regards to EDI efforts is receptive. However, workplace demographics data, internal climate surveys among observatories, and representation in academic partnerships illustrate the strong need to strengthen efforts in EDI. Concrete initiatives are facilitated by strategic planning, solid goal setting, and accountability metrics. Astronomical facilities, managing entities, and their academic partners must have EDI as a central role of their operations in order to achieve and exceed their scientific goals, and to address the ongoing inequity that is strife in international astronomy.
   Since June of 2018, efforts of EDI have continued at facilities managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), and goals have been established to implement the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategic plan for the NSF's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Laboratory (NOIRlab) that was announced October 1, 2019. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to briefly overview studies illustrating the successes of EDI efforts, 2) discuss the current demographics of AURA and National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) employees, 3) to review the framework of inclusive organizations, 4) to describe the activities of grassroots EDI initiatives at AURA facilities since June of 2018, and 5) to discuss the process of writing the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategic plan for NOIRlab. A report on the current status and important details from the process are presented.

AB Having participated in both the New Zealand Association for Environmental Education (NZAEE) and Australian Association for Environmental Education (AAEE) Research Symposia of 2016, the authors provide a critical analysis of the opportunities provided during these symposia for researchers to position themselves within the environmental education field. Each symposium is analysed in terms of its purpose and program structure, and the opportunities for researchers to communicate and share their ideas, build their research community, and frame their field. It was found that there were spaces for researchers to reinscribe the structures and practices of the environmental education field, but less space for its disruption. Furthermore, it seemed that there were some voices from the edge who were unintentionally silenced to some degree; for example, emerging researchers, women, and Indigenous people. It is recommended that symposia organisers and delegates give careful consideration to these spaces for disruption and to inclusivity when planning and attending future symposia.

AB We argue the emergence of a shift in U.S. language education policy discourses from an equity/heritage (EH) framework focused on equity for English learners and non-English heritage languages, toward a global human capital (GHC) framework linked to neoliberal considerations of the language skills of individuals and nations. This discursive shift represents a change in the audience to which language education programs are primarily marketed. Drawing on a critical approach to content analysis to test for evidence of this discursive shift in Utah, we analyzed 164 articles from 5 Utah newspapers from 2005 to 2011 that assigned value statements to dual language and bilingual education. EH values declined or changed little over time whereas GHC values increased. Policy implications are discussed.

AB Objective: To mitigate the impact of racism, sexism, and other systemic biases, it is essential for organizations to develop strategies to address their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) climates. The objective of this formative evaluation was to assess Mayo Clinic Department of Health Sciences Research (HSR) faculty and staff perceptions toward a proposed departmental DEI plan and to explore findings by diversity and professional subgroups. Materials and methods: Key plan components include recruitment and support for diverse individuals; training for all HSR employees and leaders; and a review system to capture diversity and inclusion feedback for leaders. Additional activities include building inclusion "nudges" into existing performance reviews. To assess pre-implementation beliefs about specific plan components, we polled attendees at a departmental staff meeting in July 2020. Results: Overall, respondents (n = 162) commonly endorsed a blinded promotion review process and DEI training for all staff and leaders as most important. In contrast, respondents expressed less support for plan activities related to "nudges." However, attitudes among certain diversity or professional groups toward specific plan activities diverged from their non-diversity group counterparts. Qualitative feedback indicated awareness of the need to address DEI issues. Discussion: Overall, HSR faculty and staff respondents conveyed support for the plan. However, some specific plan activities were perceived differently by members of certain diversity or professional subgroups. Conclusion: These findings present a DEI framework on which other institutions can build and point to future directions for how DEI activities may be differentially perceived by impacted faculty and staff.

AB With the 2015 passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the oversight of language policy in U.S. schools shifted from federal to state governance. Although the education of students officially designated as English learners (ELs) has historically been grounded in federal law, we argue that ELs' educational experiences are also largely influenced by societal attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Using a critical policy analysis (CPA) approach, we examine how 12 states' immigrant policy contexts are associated with the EL educational policies articulated in their ESSA implementation plans. We find that states' demographic and immigrant policy contexts combine to produce four distinct approaches toward EL education, from departing to approaching equity.

AB This research uses St. Louis, Missouri's proposed Delmar Loop Transit-oriented development (TOD) site as a case study to identify how private interests overshadow overall inclusivity within a TOD space. Through content analysis and interviews, I reveal how establishing the TOD site aims to expand the existing entertainment district, but excludes the site's predominately black and more transit-dependent West End neighborhood in TOD planning activities. Recognizing how different spaces and residents are excluded in ongoing TOD planning processes aims to highlight the spaces and residents most at risk for future displacement-pointing planners to areas of needed interventions.

AB Institutional efforts to address equity, diversity and inclusion in educational settings have been often met with overwhelmingly critical accounts pointing towards well-intentioned attempts that have reinforced exclusion and inequity. A new wave of recent developments among Canadian research-intensive universities (U15) is providing a slightly different account of universities' involvement in addressing the needs of equity-seeking students. This paper presents data collected through policy analysis of 50 strategic documents from 15 Canadian universities from 2011-2018. The findings suggest that equity, diversity and inclusion activities have become a policy priority attached to a variety of institutional action plans and performance reports. As a result, there has been an increase in institutional strategic activities including institutional political commitment (e.g. new equity offices, new senior administration positions, mandatory training), student and faculty recruitment with programmatic and research supports (e.g. diversity admission policies, scholarships, access programs, curriculum changes), accompanied by broader efforts to create supportive institutional climates (e.g. student advisors, awards, celebrations). Inconsistencies emerged amongst how equity is defined in policy documents, resulting in either redistributive or inclusive practices in equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the approach adopted by the health plans of the autonomous communities of Spain, verifying the weight given to the concept of equity; to detect referenced communities or situations, as well as to distinguish the perspective of approaching it, from access, equity or equalization.
   METHODS: Qualitative study, of content analysis using Nvivo12, carried out in 2020 on health plans in force since 2019 in the different regions (autonomous communities) of Spain. Sixteen current regional health plans were compiled to establish base categories (equity, accessibility and equality) and determine associated terms using Nvivo12, from which a content analysis was performed.
   RESULTS: The concept of equity is not emphasized in the regional health plans and its relevance is surpassed by the concepts of accessibility and equality. The use of these three concepts is associated with various categories indicating circumstances, conditions or groups to which the plans give greater attention.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained coincide with previous studies on the contents and orientation of health plans, revealing a discrete presence of the concept of equity in the approaches adopted, although this does not undermine the alignment of health policies with the visions emanating from transnational organizations. It is detected the existence of a group to which special attention is given from the accessibility approach, the population with functional diversity.

AB Public libraries are often referred to as community anchors-boundary-spanning institutions (Williams 2002) ideally positioned to inform, empower, and connect citizens in local communities. Despite American Library Association (ALA) and Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) statements explicitly valuing diversity, inclusivity, and equitable access, people with disabilities (PWD) and their families are often excluded from meaningful use of, and engagement with, local libraries. For a large portion of the autism community, the library does not provide meaningful services or information beyond early childhood and can be perceived as an unsafe space for adults with autism. This article presents secondary analysis of a survey of 635 parents of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the state of North Carolina, as well as an intersectional analysis of race, gender, disability, and information behavior. It also discusses the implications of these findings for library planning.

This coalition seeks to offer students who are often rendered invisible within the academy and society more broadly in relation to dominant cultures and normative expectations an opportunity to build relationships and expose shared histories of oppression in such a way that issues of social justice are uncovered. In response to nursing students and faculty who self-identify as members of dominant groups and who sought inclusion as allies, the leaders of the student community groups recognized a need to develop a position statement on allyship. The collaboration that transpired between the four groups of communities to develop the position statement led to the formation of the Student Equity Coalition. This article begins with the authors' definition of allyship, followed by a description of the context in which this unique initiative is taking place, the rationale behind developing a shared position statement on allyship, and the significance of this work in positioning and supporting nursing students of minority status as emerging nurse leaders.

AB Tulloch details a six-step timeline that improves ecology and conservation conference inclusion by embedding diversity and equity into planning, financing, marketing, scientific and social scheduling, evaluation and reporting.
   Conferences are important for professional learning and for building academics' reputations and networks. All members of the scientific community should feel supported and free to contribute their best at such events. I evaluated the actions and policies of conferences held by international academic societies for ecology and conservation since 2009, to assess whether conferences support participation across sexual orientations and gender identities. Although half of the 30 conferences had codes of conduct promoting equity, diversity and inclusion, the quantity and quality of initiatives to support such principles varied between societies and years. Conferences with codes were significantly more likely to implement structural initiatives to minimize discrimination or harassment, such as procedures for reporting misconduct and submission guidelines to promote speaker diversity, as well as initiatives to support parents. Initiatives minimizing barriers to attendance were rare; 47% of conferences were held in locations that discriminate against certain identities and <10% promoted event safety and accessibility to potential attendees. Piecemeal actions and inadequate conference evaluation have resulted in no significant growth in gender equity or diversity initiatives. I propose a six-step timeline that improves conference inclusion by embedding diversity and equity into planning, financing, marketing, scientific and social scheduling, evaluation and reporting.

AB Despite statements in support of racial justice, many organizations fail to make good on their commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). In this review, we describe the role of the narrative of racial progress-which conceives of society as rapidly and automatically ascending toward racial equity-in these failures. Specifically, the narrative (1) envisions organizations as race neutral, (2) creates barriers to complex cross-race discussions about equity, (3) creates momentum for less effective policy change, and (4) reduces urgency around DEI goals. Thus, an effective DEI strategy will involve organizational leaders overcoming this narrative by acknowledging past DEI failures and, most critically, implementing immediate and evidence-based structural changes that are essential for creating a more just and equitable workplace.

AB Background: The debate on equity in health, with long history and wide understanding, is more relevant today when considering the transcendence of this area. In the context of our system. it is appropriate to know the approach adopted by the autonomous communities. By analysing regional health plans in Spain it was intended to detect the perspectives applied in the search for equity. as well as to know the main goals of the plans and those groups or circumstances they try to deal with.
   Methods: Based on the procedure of constant comparative analysis and content analysis, whose statistical treatment was conducted with Nvivo software (v12) and the analysis of Jaccard and Pearson correlation indexes, along with the triangulation of methods. data and researchers, the most recent regional health plans in progress (fourth quarter of 2019) were screened.
   Results: Analized plans brought out that the search for equity is not given sufficient relevance. However, there are specific circumstances that standed out among the references to equity in the plans. Accessibility arised as a key category to understand the setup of health care as a public policy.
   Conclusions: The main paradigm found in regional health plans is that of equality or equity in access to health. To a lesser extent, it is also present a search for equal opportunities for various specific groups, such as people suffering from mental illness, people with functional diversity or who face some of the barriers or difficulties associated with the gender gap. Other items or groups considered by the regional administrations in a more reduced way. but also in a different manner, are immigration. rural habitat and infrastructures and elderly people.

AB The summer 2020 protests following the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and other African-Americans sparked important conversations about race, police brutality, and institutionalized racism in the United States. In response to widespread civil unrest, organizations across the country issued statements condemning anti-Black violence and supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. This essay analyzes public statements released by 50 outdoor sport and recreation organizations. Extending scholarly literature on race and corporate social advocacy, our analysis develops the concept of conciliatory discourse, which functions by rhetorically constructing 1) a non-specification of grievance, 2) an obfuscation of commitments to action, and 3) a reinforcement of previous actions or processes. We argue that while many outdoor recreation organizations took action in support of racial justice, their public statements complicate long-term commitments for inclusivity and diversity.

AB This article investigates the level of country ownership and inclusivity in Feed the Future (FtF) projects in Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Senegal, and Tanzania. It finds that though interventions largely align with country-defined priorities and plans, other aspects of country ownership consultation and provision of aid through local systems - are weaker than expected. Regarding inclusion, FtF is to some extent exclusive, perhaps as an unintended consequence of alignment with national development plans that do not reasonably promote equity. Focus is mostly on productive areas and 'market-ready' smallholders. The article suggests policy actions needed to better achieve expected results.

AB It is time to move past the words-the well-crafted statements circulated by groups and organizations across the academy, the scholarly writing as displacement, the formal and informal critiques-as if they had some recognizable impact. Each of these rhetorical moves can be valuable in helping to effect larger cultural and structural shifts. Yet, alone, a variety of evidence suggests that these forms of communication fail at effecting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Therefore, through our varied areas of research and lived work experiences, we focus attention toward actions as sites of power and potential: (a) in faculty emotional labor and work (McLeod), (b) at various levels of university administration and structural change (Ashcraft and Allen), (c) in the time-based practices associated with the ways we teach and mentor graduate students (Ballard), and (d) in our corpus of scholarship (Ganesh and Zoller).

AB As racialized institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions educate large portions of racially minoritized students within organizational and policy structures that advance Whiteness. This research considers how the institution-level diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plans, produced in response to state-level DEI policies in Florida, California, and New York, construct narratives of intersectional diversity and a racialized Latinx identity at Hispanic-serving community colleges (HSCCs). Engaging critical discourse analysis, drawing together critical race theory and LatCrit, the analysis expands the consideration of DEI policy implementation at HSCCs. The findings illustrate the interconnectedness of state-level policy, policy implementation guidance, and institution-level discourse related to defining intersectional diversity and demographic data. Furthermore, it captures a lack of attention to racial composition among Latinx students and the limited characterization of HSI status. This study highlights how the implementation of state-level DEI policies can advance or erase the considerations of intersectionality among Latinx students.

AB Racism has been a part of academic medicine, including in neurology, for generations. While some neurology departments had an infrastructure to promote diversity and inclusion prior to 2020, several high-profile events that occurred that year-including the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, nationwide protests over police brutality and White supremacy, as well as the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color-catapulted anti-racism onto the agendas of academic departments across the country. In the last year, many neurology departments have appointed diversity officers. Statements condemning racism and supporting equity, diversity, and inclusion are now featured prominently on neurology program webpages, and neurology training programs promote their efforts to foster equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) on social media to attract more applications from physicians from groups that are underrepresented in medicine. These encouraging changes suggest that neurology department leaders recognize the importance of EDI, anti-racism, and social justice, but are they committing their departments to action or simply reacting to the social climate?

AB Introduction Rapid urbanization increases competition for scarce urban resources and underlines the need for policies that promote equitable access to resources. This study examined equity and social inclusion of urban development policies in Nigeria through the lenses of access to health and food/nutrition resources. Method Desk review of 22 policy documents, strategies, and plans within the ambit of urban development was done. Documents were sourced from organizational websites and offices. Data were extracted by six independent reviewers using a uniform template designed to capture considerations of access to healthcare and food/nutrition resources within urban development policies/plans/strategies in Nigeria. Emerging themes on equity and social inclusion in access to health and food/nutirition resources were identified and analysed. Results Access to health and food/nutrition resources were explicit in eight (8) and twelve (12) policies/plans, respectively. Themes that reflect potential policy contributions to social inclusion and equitable access to health resources were: Provision of functional and improved health infrastructure; Primary Health Care strengthening for quality health service delivery; Provision of safety nets and social health insurance; Community participation and integration; and Public education and enlightenment. With respect to nutrition resources, emergent themes were: Provision of accessible and affordable land to farmers; Upscaling local food production, diversification and processing; Provision of safety nets; Private-sector participation; and Special considerations for vulnerable groups. Conclusion There is sub-optimal consideration of access to health and nutrition resources in urban development policies in Nigeria. Equity and social inclusivity in access to health and nutrition resources should be underscored in future policies.

AB A mutual benefits strategy is proposed to reduce political resistance to greater social equity. Growing racial diversity signals a new era, but emphasis on projected change provokes defensive reactions. The twenty-first-century demography also includes massive aging and a white voting majority until 2060, so benefits of equity should be detailed for the older generation. Those include better workers, taxpayers, and home buyers resulting from investment in the new generation. Emphasis on intergenerational mutual benefits bridges divides and can build support for a broader agenda of a shared future. The mutual benefits strategy could help curb the polarization widening in America.

DE leadership; diversity; inclusiveness; medical education
AB Both in Canada and globally, medical schools are prioritizing diversity in medical education. The ensuing development of innovative approaches to augmenting the representation, comfort, and success of students from under-represented groups has been increasing. Curricula have also expanded to better prepare graduates for the realities of effectively meeting the needs of a diverse patient population. Leadership has however, not kept up with this progress. Evidence shows that diverse leadership teams develop innovative solutions to complex problems, recruit and retain the best talent, and remain relevant to the communities they serve.
   Our international conference workshop included a literature review on the current state of diversity in medical education and in leadership for medical educators, and case-based models of lived experiences to initiate conversations in three different facets of diversity to stimulate reflection, engagement and discussion. The oft-forgotten side of the conversation in conference offerings, the audience's perspective, was purposefully included in planning the workshop and presenters adhered to this principle throughout the session.
   Participants recognized the importance of addressing diversity with leadership in medical education. Themes included the need for communication training, cultural education, sharing these data more broadly with faculty in medical education and continuing these conversations. A final theme "we will never represent all minorities", led us to a conclusion that a culture of inclusivity and not diversity would be required to successfully meet this challenge.

AB This article discusses the University of Global Health Equity (UGHE)'s use of a Gender Equity and Diversity Inclusion Audit as a tool to mainstream gender and minority groups' inclusion. The internal audit analysed gender and minority groups' inclusiveness, sensitivity and/or awareness in institutional programmes, projects, plans, practices and policies, and identified the gaps within. This article gives an overview on why and how UGHE (Rwanda) created a single tool for an internal audit covering both gender equity and minority inclusion, implemented by its Center for Gender Equity (CGE) with the participation of students, staff and faculty from both its Butaro campus, and Kigali headquarters, in Rwanda. The tool is based on a four-part methodology that includes a desk review of official university documents, self-assessment questionnaires for employees and students, in-depth interviews, and consultative meetings with selected staff and UGHE leaders. The data collected through this robust audit allowed for the identification of gaps in the mainstreaming of gender and minority inclusion - the main ones are briefly discussed in the article - and this will guide the design of UGHE's strategy to correct these. The gender mainstreaming strategy's ultimate objective is advancing institutional equity.

The survey posed questions related to equity plans and programs as well as recruitment practices for academic librarians from equity-seeking groups with a focus on Aboriginal and visible/racial minority librarians. It explored the needs and experiences of Aboriginal and visible/racial minority librarians employed in Canadian academic libraries by examining questions of organizational climate, mentoring, institutional support, advancement opportunities, and the roles of library associations. The findings reveal a need for more diversity awareness and training and leadership with respect to diversity on the part of academic libraries and the profession at large in Canada.

AB Introduction: Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are receiving considerable attention in higher education. Within psychology, the American Psychological Association has highlighted the importance of cultural diversity in both undergraduate and graduate curricula and charged educators with facilitating the development of cultural competence among learners. Statement of the Problem: Many resources have been developed to help promote EDI within higher education. The resources developed have mainly focused on the curricula and pedagogical approaches, yet the syllabus remains overlooked with few guidelines available to educators. Literature Review: We offer several considerations informed by theoretical frameworks and best practices in the discipline and suggestions for the successful implementation of EDI in the syllabus. Teaching Implications: This article provides a comprehensive and useful guide for developing a syllabus that assists with the integration of EDI, as the syllabus is the first opportunity for faculty to communicate their philosophy, expectations, requirements, and other course information. Conclusion: Infusing EDI in the syllabus is essential for promoting an inclusive learning environment and is conducive to establishing goals related to cultural competence.

AB As cities continue to grow worldwide, policymakers and urban planners face the dual task of meeting rising demand for essential services while ensuring that benefits accrue to their citizens equitably. We propose a framework for assessing inclusivity and equity in cities, which leverages open data and machine learning techniques to inform urban infrastructure investment strategies. The framework is applied at a regional scale to compare differential access to healthcare facilities (public hospitals and clinics) via public transit in Vancouver, Seattle and Portland. We find important distributional impacts on vulnerable populations across the three cities. Portland displays the highest inequity in hospital and clinic access, and Vancouver the least, owing to Vancouver's relatively compact geographic area and high population density. For seniors, over 75% are socially excluded from hospitals and over 50% from clinics in Portland, compared to 30% and 3% respectively in Vancouver. In all three cities, significantly more residents of low-income neighborhoods are excluded from healthcare compared to their counterparts in high-income neighborhoods. This translates into proportionally higher transportation costs for low-income area residents compared with high-income area residents, regardless of whether they are socially excluded or not. Transportation costs are notably high for low-income seniors in Seattle and Vancouver. These findings pose a challenge for inclusive planning, since low-income and senior populations may require specialized services and are more reliant on public transportation than the average population. Our evaluation framework provides a systematic approach for municipalities to account for the distributional effects of transportation and service infrastructure planning, to integrate equity into their decision-making, and to learn from the successes and pitfalls of each other's urban policies.

AB The dismantling of equity oriented urban policies has led to a call for a 'just city' agenda where policies are directed towards equity, diversity and democracy rather than growth and cultural protectionism. This paper presents a first assessment of political support for the 'just city' and investigates its conditioning factors, building on a European survey of city mayors. We find a strong association with leftist ideology, but also enabling conditions for the support of conservative mayors. The positive predisposition of leftist mayors, however, wains with increasing dependence on EU funding. The exploratory study thus opens new avenues for further research.

AB Publication bias has been shown to exist in research across medical and surgical specialties. Bias can occur at any stage of the publication process and can be related to race, ethnicity, age, religion, sex, gender, or sexual orientation. Although some improvements have been made toward addressing this issue, bias still spans the publication process from authors and peer reviewers, to editorial board members and editors, with poor inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities throughout. The result of bias remaining unchecked is the publication of research that leaves out certain groups, is not applicable to all people, and can result in harm to some populations. We have highlighted the current landscape of publication bias and strived to demonstrate the importance of addressing it. We have also provided solutions for reducing bias at multiple stages throughout the publication process. Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout all aspects of the publication process, requiring diversity, equity, and inclusion statements in reports, and providing specific education and guidelines will ensure the identification and eradication of publication bias. By following these measures, we hope that publication bias will be eliminated, which will reduce further harm to certain populations and promote better, more effective research pertinent to all people.

AB While there is a substantial conceptual literature on equality in education, there has been little clarificatory discussion on the term equity, despite its frequent use in policy and planning documents. The article draws out some different ways in which equity can be understood in education. It distinguishes three forms of equity, looking at the social context when major shifts in the meaning of the term took place in English-the fourteenth century, the sixteenth century and the eighteenth century. Terming these equity from below, equity from above, and equity from the middle, the analysis highlights how each helps clarify aspects of the concern with diversity within the capability approach. The conclusion drawn is that all three forms of equity need to be placed in articulation to expand capabilities in education.

Facilitating inclusive learning in culturally diverse environments is complex and requires strategic planning and supports at both institutional and classroom levels. Nurse educators have a central role in cultivating intercultural inclusivity. Ensuring cultural diversity is valued, and students' cultural identities and educational backgrounds are respected are important. Culturally responsive teaching is fundamental as culture influences the way students learn. This paper outlines specific strategies for nurse educators to consider when planning culturally responsive teaching as a means of nurturing intercultural inclusiveness. Understanding student learning needs and vulnerabilities, facilitating respectful discussions, challenging assumptions, and encouraging intercultural dialogue, are vital areas for consideration.

AB A model of Diversity and Equity for building inclusive excellence in graduate engineering education is proposed as a systemic action plan for achieving high diversity and equity impacts in women and underrepresented minority (URM) STEM graduate education. The proposed model is implemented through the following six strategic dimensions:
   Foster institutional leadership engagement that maximizes receptivity for diversity and equity by focusing on the systemic, organizational, and structural realignments necessary to support all the other five dimensions
   Establish criteria for institutional high diversity impact, climate, and culture that support all graduate students and engages all of its diversity in the service of graduate students.
   Establish a multi-campus outreach framework for URM motivation for STEM fields.
   Develop multi-campus partnerships for URM capacity building and access into PhD program.
   Build a graduate student-centered community and professional development opportunities by developing a structure for effective community engagement and mentoring partnership with all stakeholders for the production of increased number of URM STEM PhDs.
   Evaluate Diversity and Equity outcomes and reward departments that make highest impact in closing student equity, diversity or educational outcomes gaps.
   A mathematical diversity model that presents diversity impact as a linear function of the intentional actions or performances in Access (A), Retention Rate (R-r), Graduation Rate (G), Quality (Q), Climate (C), and Receptivity (R-e) is presented with the corresponding diversity contribution coefficients. The Engineering Research Center (ERC) is shown as a case example of a purposeful development and utilization of organizational resources to improve graduate engineering education through multi-campus approach. A summary of the diversity portion of the ERC's strategic plan and progress in the past three years in relation to the milestones for "High Quality Diversity Effort" is highlighted. The key performance indicators show that ERC through its partnering institutions is making measurable impact in capacity building for a STEM workforce as seen in the broad involvement of underrepresented minority students and faculty in center activities. Project CARE was used as case example of college transition program that was implemented based on the proposed model activities. The results show that Project CARE contributed to 86% educational growth and performance improvement among URM students who scored lowest on the pre-test. The program was effective in preparing high school students for college level math and science instructions, as well as enriching their academic performance skills and abilities to excel in their senior year of high school.

AB This article presents the results of a comparative and critical study of the competency standards of Quebec school administrators compared with seven other education systems within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). An inductive-type analysis has made it possible to identify the social categories targeted in the standards, the vision of school leaders as well as the competencies that are likely to help advance educational and societal goals of equity, inclusion, and social justice. Three contrasting perspectives emerge from this analysis. In Australia, California, and the United States, principals are explicitly encouraged to take action against structures and practices that undermine the educational success and social recognition of minority groups. In British Columbia and New Zealand, statements about social diversity focus more on the transformation of individual practices. Finally, in the standards of England, Texas and Quebec, only a few generic statements referring to the differentiated needs of students and their success have been identified. They are instead characterized by a managerial approach oriented toward results that are measurable and cost controlled. In conclusion, a more in-depth analysis of the Quebec standards opens the door to a new competency model and recommendations.

DE Sociology; race; racism; color-blind; diversity; equity; inclusion
AB The Black Lives Matter protests, the racial inequality laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol prompted several organizations and academic institutions to write statements in support of the Movement for Black Lives and to re-evaluate their dedication to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Using auto-ethnographical analysis, I address the inadequacy of such liberal initiatives to effectively challenge racial barriers to the promotion and retention of faculty of color, especially women of color. In fact, I argue that such initiatives could present further challenges for women of color, who are only included superficially and in ways that create more invisible, unrecognized labor. I propose that the language of DEI efforts must more centrally name racism at the same time that they address intersectionality through what I call racism-centered intersectional approaches. These approaches are particularly needed given the history of attacks on ethnic studies and critical race theory.

AB Purpose Racism and colonialism impact health, physician advancement, professional development and medical education in Canada. The Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) has committed to addressing inequities in health in their recent statement on racism. The objective of this project was to develop recommendations for addressing racism and colonialism in emergency medicine. Methods The authors, in collaboration with a 40 member working group, conducted a literature search, held a community consultation, solicited input from expert medical, academic and community advisors, conducted a national survey of emergency physicians, and presented draft recommendations at the 2021 CAEP Academic Symposium on Equity, Diversity and Inclusion for a live facilitated discussion with a post-session survey. Results Sixteen recommendations were generated in the areas of patient care, hospital and departmental commitment to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, physician advancement, and professional development and medical education. Conclusion Emergency physicians are uniquely positioned to promote equity at each encounter with patients, peers and learners. The 16 recommendations presented here are practical steps to countering racism and colonialism everyday in emergency medicine.

AB Scholars argue or imply that schools should build transformative school visions that promote equity, diversity, and social justice. However, little empirical research has investigated the principal's role in this endeavor or analyzed the practical dimensions of transformative vision statements. This study re-examined relevant data from two qualitative studies of school principals who were peer-nominated for exemplary transformative practices. The findings delineate principals' practices in developing a transformative vision and suggest several useful dimensions of transformative vision statements. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB Background: A lack of diversity in the nursing workforce nationally has been identified by Oregon state leaders as a factor contributing to health inequity. Method: The goal of Advancing Health Equity Through Student Empowerment and Professional Success (HealthE STEPS) is to graduate nursing students from disadvantaged backgrounds to improve health equity within their communities. A comprehensive plan of evidence-based strategies was developed based on social determinants of health and addresses academic socialization, learning support, financial resources, networking, curriculum development, and campus culture. Results: Ninety undergraduate nursing students participated in the program during a 2-year period. Retention of participants was 97% with graduation rates of 94%. First-time licensure pass rates were 82% and 96% of participating graduates employed in a medically underserved community. Conclusion: This comprehensive innovative program of evidence-based strategies addresses health equity by developing a diverse nursing workforce to practice in medically underserved communities.

ID META-SYNTHESIS
AB For the past two decades, the South African government, through various initiatives, attempted to undo the apartheid spatial landform existing in the country. Only in 2013 was the real 'spatial justice turn in planning' formally introduced in planning legislation. Little is known about the spatial justice concept and how it should be applied to planning and development activities. This article proposes positioning spatial justice within the wider justice and social justice discourse. Using a meta-synthesis, this article proposes a working definition of spatial justice in an attempt to unravel the properties and nuances within it. The meta-synthesis frames the concept of spatial justice to possess equity, diversity, democracy, just distribution, benefit of the disadvantaged, and access to necessary resources to meet basic needs. This working definition could be used to develop a framework to operationalise spatial justice, helping policy makers and practitioners undo spatial injustices that exist in our geographies.

AB In 2009, the U.S. Department of Education distributed $2,500,000 via a competitive grant program, the Technical Assistance for Student Assignment Plans, to 11 school districts. The grants and their local effects provide an opportunity to examine the new politics of diversity in public education. Participants cited a wide range of conceptions of diversity, most of which were race-neutral. Some districts enacted policies deemphasizing their original diversity goals. Even in Technical Assistance for Student Assignment Plans (TASAP) districts, whose leaders presumably value diversity, diversity was not always a compelling goal when competing with priorities such as fiscal austerity, school improvement, and neighborhood school demands. Future federal efforts to increase students' exposure to diverse peers should recognize that local conditions might create contrary political pressures for local policymakers.

AB Drawing on calls to diversify the teacher workforce, this paper demonstrates the need for a commitment to diversity and equity in recruiting Black women into the recruiting practices of educational organizations. Three approaches by which educational organizations incorporate diversity and equity into their recruiting practices are organized in a typology: status quo, strategic, and special emphasis recruiting (SER). Due to its cultural sensibility, SER can best support recruiters in the education field to develop the cogent recruitment plans that are needed to recruit a highly diverse teacher workforce in general, and BWTs in particular. The paper concludes with a reminder to readers as to the motives for expanding the representation of Black women in our nation's schools.

AB Social disparities in NAEP student outcomes with respect to geography provide further evidence of how far the discipline of Geography still must go to address issues of diversity, equity, inclusion. Addressing these issues requires difficult but necessary conversations and planning of initiatives along with a more fundamental re-envisioning of what Geography education is, for whom the learning of geography matters and why, and a commitment to decolonize curriculum and pedagogical approaches. Such reform has the promise of not only making Geography education more responsive to social difference and justice, but it also ultimately will increase the intellectual and political efficacy of our profession.

AB Public Significance Statement When teaching about social identities, diversity, and inequality, it is important for instructors and facilitators to understand what awareness, knowledge, and skills students need to master. This article explains the process of how students learn about diversity, the way motivation drives the process, and what resistance might be encountered along the way.
   Objectives: Many scholars and educators have written about how to approach teaching about social identities, diversity, and societal inequity in classrooms and beyond. The current article adds to this literature by considering the developmental trajectories of individuals as they engage in learning opportunities about identities, diversity, and equity. Results: This article details the specific aspects of knowledge that are essential to develop cultural competence and critical consciousness as well as a sequence in which they should be acquired. Conclusions: Previous models emphasize progressive movement toward more advanced levels, but this article explains how motivation can explain movement and stalling in development. Furthermore, it analyzes the cognitive and motivational antecedents of resistance to diversity learning opportunities. The article concludes with implications for teaching and future directions for research.

AB Music programs in higher education systems have historically operated from a Eurocentric point of view, and many programs still endorse an outdated hierarchy that places classical music above all other genres. Despite the inherent cultural and artistic value of American popular music, the United States lags behind other countries in granting popular music study a meaningful place in higher educational models. While significant structural changes to ensure that all genres of music receive equal attention and resources within university music programs develop, the authors have compiled a list of tools voice teachers can use to practice increased equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging (EDIB) within our singing voice studios. These include (1) embracing intentional pedagogical practices; (2) avoiding cultural appropriation or cultural approximation; (3) continuing to seek education; (4) acknowledging our areas of excellence, knowing what is beyond the scope of our expertise, and having the courage to ask for help; (5) naming courses and programs accurately; and (6) developing an equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging statement for the voice studio. As a form of combating systemic exclusion, voice teachers can take meaningful steps to foster a racially, ethnically, culturally, and musically inclusive singing voice studio.

AB Cultural diversity in professional fields, including science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), leads to greater innovation due to the improved range of ideas, perspectives, and talents that a diverse workforce encompasses. However, despite increased efforts to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented minority students through collegiate-level STEM equity initiatives, the lack of action research-based program evaluation leaves unanswered questions about the effectiveness of many STEM equity programs. The current article uses an example of a grant-funded collaboration between two Hispanic-serving institutions to explore how action research can enhance the planning, implementation, and evaluation of programs to address STEM inequity. A narrative of researcher-participants' reflections illustrates the successes and shortcomings of the project and suggests four guidelines for enhancing STEM equity programs with action research.

AB The participation of diverse demographics in higher education has risen over the last half-century; meanwhile, different political and social tiers have been assigning a more active role to institutions in terms of equality and social justice. This change in circumstances has led to the roll out of processes to institutionalise diversity outreach. This study was conducted for the clear purpose of assessing the current institutionalisation status of diversity outreach in 127 key universities from the Academic Ranking of World Universities based on the opinions of diversity outreach managers and the information published on institutional websites, in turn measuring compliance with various indicators. A qualitative analysis of the institutional statements, the goals sought through strategic plans and the definitions of diversity itself was also conducted. The evidence reveals the early stage of the institutionalisation process in universities on account of the low percentage obtained for the proposed indicators. Furthermore, the study failed to exhibit significant differences in this process in terms of the institutional ownership or position held in the ranking; however, more prominent progress was noted in the North-American region when geographical differences were taken into account, likely as a result of the historical background in the advocacy for equal opportunities. Lastly, a change of approach to the conceptualisation of diversity is suggested in favour of equality and social justice.

AB Never has there been a more pressing time for the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP) to articulate a unified strategy to meet the challenges of our aging world. To this end, this report summarizes an AAGP leadership meeting that reviewed the results from a recent membership survey and launched a strategic planning process on behalf of AAGP members and stakeholders. This meeting was the first step in drafting a blueprint for the future that may serve as our guide in the context of finite resources to meet the infinitely complex and growing need for education, research, public advocacy, and clinical practice support. The following report serves to invite our valued colleagues to provide feedback and actively participate in defining our mission. Among the outcomes of the planning session, the following aspirations were identified by the participants 1) assert the AAGP as the "go to" organization for all things related to geriatric mental health, 2) prioritize activities that enhance the inclusivity/diversity of membership, and 3) collaborate across disciplines focused on geriatric mental health. From this initial framework, the group developed four general themes to guide AAGP's strategic future: 1) collaboration, 2) advocacy, 3) inclusivity, 4) high purpose. Inclusivity was further defined as encompassing growth, return on investment, and workforce development. Higher purpose was further defined as encompassing engagement, purpose, branding, communication, and expertise. The AAGP affirmed its commitment to serving the needs of its members and widening its scope of impact in view of staggering demands for better access to geriatric mental healthcare.

AB BACKGROUND: In nearly all areas of academic medicine, disparities still exist for women and underrepresented minorities (URMs).
   OBJECTIVES: Develop a strategic plan for advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); implement and evaluate the plan, specifically focusing on compensation, recruitment, and policies.
   DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Programmatic evaluation conducted in the division of hospital medicine (DHM) at a major academic medical center involving DHM faculty and staff.
   MEASUREMENTS: (1) Development and implementation of strategic plan, including policies, processes, and practices related to key components of DEI program; (2) assessment of specific DEI outcomes, including plan implementation, pre-post salary data disparities based on academic rank, and pre-post disparities for protected time for similar roles.
   RESULTS: Using information gathered from a focus group with DHM faculty, an iterative strategic plan for DEI was developed and deployed, with key components of focus being institutional structures, our people, our environments, and our core mission areas. A director of DEI was established to help oversee these efforts. Using a two-phase approach, salary disparities by rank were eliminated. Internally funded protected time was standardized for leadership roles. A data dashboard has been developed to track high-level successes and areas for future focus.
   CONCLUSION: Using a systematic evidence-based approach with key stakeholder involvement, a division-wide DEI strategy was developed and implemented. While this work is ongoing, short-term wins are possible, in particular around salary equity and development of policies and structures to promote DEI. (C) 2021 Society of Hospital Medicine

AB Cities across the world are confronted by a growing ethnic and racial diversity that challenges the traditional model of urban planning intervention focused on individual, not group, differences. This article examines urban planning in three ethnically polarized settings-Belfast, Jerusalem, and Johannesburg-to ascertain how planners treat complex and emotional issues of ethnic identity and group-based claims. Four models of planning intervention-neutral, partisan, equity, and resolver-are examined through interviews with over 100 planners and policy officials. The article outlines the significant implications of these cases in terms of the limitations and potential contributions of American urban planning to effectively accommodate ethnic and cultural differences.

ID FOOD
AB Meetings and events present opportunities to bring together diverse groups of people. Reflective of the greater diversity and inclusion movements in the country, event planners are tasked with creating agendas that support these initiatives. Creating these agendas often involves menu planning and development for meals and snacks served during the event. Culture is a social construct that can be described as the behaviors, values and beliefs that a group of people shares. Race, ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, and geographical location all contribute to culture and cultural diversity. Conversely, a lack of culturally appropriate options for attendees, including food options, may lead to feelings of unwelcomeness or outright exclusion. This paper discusses food as a reflection of culture and therefore, a mechanism for conveying an agenda supporting diversity and inclusivity. A review of literature was conducted to determine strategies for constructing menus and food schedules that support this agenda and presents an opportunity for cultural exchange in which food experiences, traditions, and knowledge are shared among attendees with various backgrounds. Leveraging this opportunity for cultural exchange using food as the vehicle requires knowledge of the expected demographics of attendees, culturally competent foodservice professionals, and purposeful integration of food into event programming.

TI Reclaiming the mission of academic medicine: An examination of

ID DIVERSITY; STATEMENTS
AB Purpose The utility of institutional statements is said to provide clarity and reinforcement of an institution's goal. Unfortunately, it can also be argued that these statements are in clear misalignment between the words described and the environments that faculty, students, trainees, and staff of color face. The purpose of this study was to analyze academic medicine institutional statements that responded to 2020 racial tensions following the murders of George Floyd, among others, and the subsequent nationwide protests against police brutality. Methods We conducted a manifest content analysis of institutional statements generated by academic medical centers after George Floyd's murder. We used manifest content analysis to gain insights into how institutional statements connect structural racism to the mission of academic medicine. We collected and examined institutional statements from 26 academic medicine centers. Selection parameters included statements that were publicly available and published by the institutions during a 2-week period. We conducted a four-stage analysis: decontextualization, recontextualization, categorization, and compilation. To better understand the collection of statements, we plotted these institutional statements according to the most salient discussed themes. Results Overall, institutional statements discussed racism through three subthemes: identifying the racial implications of health disparities, issuing a call to action to address racism, and decentering race. Absent language is also noted. Second, institutional statements evoked institutional values by expressing an explicit connection with the academic medicine mission, naming the value of social justice, and emphasizing the concept of community. Finally, institutional statements largely discussed public health in connection with racism or with institutional values. Conclusion Our study determines a much-needed reconnection to the mission of academic medicine. Reclaiming the social mission will be a major step toward recentering the foundation of institutional actions. This call is what ultimately will improve the health and well-being of marginalized populations.

ID ISSUES
AB The rapid growth and accumulation of specialized knowledge in today's biomedical fields, combined with entrenched and emerging health issues that persist among certain groups within the US population, emphasizes the significant need to diversify the nation's biomedical science workforce. The under-representation of minorities in science results in inadequate scientific input from divergent social or cultural perspectives and detracts from our nation's ability to resolve health disparities. The University of North Texas Health Science Center at. Fort Worth has developed a coordinated approach with local, regional, and national partners to increase participation of underrepresented students along the career pathway from K-12 to faculty level. Career stage specific activities that include research, mentoring, networking, career development, grantsmanship and health disparities curriculum are provided for participants. Successful outcomes from our coordinated plan includes an increase in participant self-efficacy, research presentation awards, increase in grant awards and publications, and career advancement. Through partnerships within our institution, local school districts, and minority serving institutions nationwide, our coordinated plan provides mutually beneficial colearning experiences to increase the number of under-represented individuals entering translational research focused on increasing the biomedical research workforce diversity and achieving health equity.

AB This article was presented at the 20009 American Academy of Kinesiology and Physical Education's annual meeting, October 1-3, 2009. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) continues to redefine the public research university for the 21st century as an inclusive, collaborative, and responsive institution making a difference in the lives of students and the communities it serves. We chronical UNCG's journey to become a more inclusive community and present the universities' statement on diversity and inclusiveness, institutional profile, historical overview of processes taken for diversifying the faculty, and initiatives for creating a more inclusive campus. This paper provides data gathered from the Deans Council Subcommittee on Recruitment and Retention of Ethnic Minority Faculty, survey data from The Campus Unity Council and focus group data from The Inclusive Community Initiative Task Force. We concluded by highlighting accomplishments from implemented recommendations and plans for our continued journey in developing a more inclusive 21st century university.
   UNCG fully supports and values an inclusive community where there is visible and meaningful representation of the diversity present in the wider community at all university levels. Diversity is the combination of characteristics, experiences, and competences that make each person unique, and increases the value of our community. We strive to maintain a climate of equity and respect, where we protect the rights of all to ensure that every member feels empowered, valued, and respected for their contributions to the mission of the university. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro is committed to providing all staff, faculty, and students' equitable access to services, benefits, and opportunities.

AB Cultural competence is increasingly recognized as an essential component of effective mental health care delivery to address diversity and equity issues. Drawing from the literature and our experience in providing cultural competence consultation and training, the paper will discuss our perspective on the foundational concepts of cultural competence and how it applies to a health care organization, including its programs and services. Based on a recent consultation project, we present a methodology for assessing cultural competence in health care organizations, involving mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Key findings and recommendations from the resulting cultural competence plan are discussed, including core principles, change strategies, and an Organizational Cultural Competence Framework, which may be applicable to other health care institutions seeking such changes. This framework, consisting of eight domains, can be used for organizational assessment and cultural competence planning, ultimately aiming at enhancing mental health care service to the diverse patients, families, and communities.

AB This article considers the factors contributing to the recent international trend for a differentiation between planning and urban design. It considers these highly related fields from the perspective of neoliberalism, global competition, and the doxa of New Urbanism. The article argues that urban design needs to be retained as an important subset of planning practice, concerned with the physical design of cities, so that the core planning values of serving the public interest in the attainment of social equity, democratic civil society, and an ecologically sustainable future may be maintained in our city-building processes.

AB Planning in modem urban environments requires skills to address complexity in order to move towards sustainability. Co-production of knowledge in transdisciplinary groups represents a useful tool in such contexts. Using the concepts of epistemic communities, linguistic diversity and culture, the article proposes a conceptual framework for analysing complexity of co-production settings, as an indispensable means of managing complex challenges, thus making these complexities visible for the project leader (facilitator) and the participants of the co-production process. We evaluate the framework on the basis of inclusivity, cross-sectoral understanding, applicability in different contexts and time perspectives. Based on the framework, we identify several aspects that a process leader (facilitator) would need to address when preparing for a coproduction process: linguistic equality between participants, disciplinary integrity, a working culture of mutual respect, simultaneous mitigation and informed facilitation. Finally, the article suggests possible future research areas related to development of the framework, including (i) identification of levels of complexity and mapping specific tools to address complexity at each level; (ii) integration of other factors of complexity, such as political and institutional contexts, as well as diversity of gender and age in the facilitated group.

ID CAPITAL GAINS; TAXATION; CORPORATE; POLICY; DEBT
AB Investors frequently hold equity in pensions and other tax-exempt savings plans, despite the prediction of the standard model that they hold only bonds. We provide a new explanation for this empirical puzzle based on differences between tax-exempt and taxable assets in the tax treatment of capital losses. We show how limits on refundability of losses on taxable equities leads to diversity of investors' preferences for corporate leverage on the basis of tax rates. In the simplest equilibrium of the model, tax-exempt savers hold risky, highly levered equities, while low-bracket taxable savers hold bonds and high-bracket taxpayers hold relatively safe, unlevered equities. We discuss the implications of tax-exempts for risk taking and agency costs within the firm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Visual and verbal cues can reinforce barriers to access for women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. Psychologically inclusive design is an evidence-based approach to reduce psychological barriers by strategically placing content and design cues in the environment. Two largefi eld experiments provide estimates of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive cues on women's and men's enrollment behaviors in an online learning environment. First, a gender-inclusive photo and statement in an online advertisement for a STEM course increased the click-through rate among women but not men by 26% (N=209,000). Second, an inclusivity statement with a gender-inclusive course image to the enrollment page raised the proportion of women enrolling in a STEM course by up to 18% (N=63,000). Thesefindings contribute evidence of the behavioral impact of psychologically inclusive design to the literature and yield practical implications for the presentation of STEM opportunities.

AB The construction of social housing in gentrifying neighbourhoods can ignite contestation, revealing tensions between economic imperatives, social policy and neighbourhood change. With a view to understanding how the convergence of these agendas preserve unpopular, but socially critical housing infrastructure, the aim of this paper is to explore how the challenges social housing implementation encounters across these agendas intersect with a broader agenda for local democratic planning. Using social housing as our empirical focus and directing attention to the gentrifying local government area of Port Phillip in Victoria, Australia, this paper reveals how a council's main asset to support implementation - its policy frameworks - creates an urban narrative of social inclusivity and diversity. Through this case, we illustrate how elected officials and some residents draw from these policies to interject into episodes of community contestation, which we argue presents opportunities to expose and renew commitments to social housing over space and time.

AB There is a growing recognition of the contribution that privately-owned land makes to conservation efforts, and governments are increasingly counting privately protected areas (PPAs) towards their international conservation commitments. The public availability of spatial data on countries' conservation estates is important for broad-scale conservation planning and monitoring and for evaluating progress towards targets. Yet there has been limited consideration of how PPA data is reported to national and international protected area databases, particularly whether such reporting is transparent and fair (i.e., equitable) to the landholders involved. Here we consider PPA reporting procedures from three countries with high numbers of PPAsAustralia, South Africa, and the United Statesillustrating the diversity within and between countries regarding what data is reported and the transparency with which it is reported. Noting a potential tension between landholder preferences for privacy and security of their property information and the benefit of sharing this information for broader conservation efforts, we identify the need to consider equity in PPA reporting processes. Unpacking potential considerations and tensions into distributional, procedural, and recognitional dimensions of equity, we propose a series of broad principles to foster transparent and fair reporting. Our approach for navigating the complexity and context-dependency of equity considerations will help strengthen PPA reporting and facilitate the transparent integration of PPAs into broader conservation efforts.

AB Many scholarly works have identified potential strategies for hiring underrepresented minority faculty members. However, no known nationwide study of business schools has explored whether these various strategies are associated with more faculty diversity. The authors explored best practices in corporations and higher education in the following areas: diversity priorities, strategic planning, outreach to underrepresented minority communities, administrative structures, and diversity training. The nationwide survey of business school deans showed that authority structures, which have proven to work in business, also are effective in academia. Similar to business results, training programs by themselves do not seem to be effective in increasing diversity.

AB We propose a framework of 29 Future School Elements that can be used to consider future models of schooling which we have organised across three pillars of pedagogy, policy and structure. We seek to position the framework within a futures approach to policy making that allows for greater diversity by providing a design logic that can be contextualised, is more pluralistic and can be shaped by a greater number of voices. The findings from our modified Delphi study involved an expert panel who examined the counterfactual research question 'What if compulsory schooling was a 21st-century invention?' Consensus statements were formed by the expert panel by rating items based on impact and equity. We explore ways in which utilising a foresight approach can provide a means to reshape future models of schooling in a meaningful and contemporary way that takes account of some of the challenges and forces that have prevented change.

SO JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE accountability; diversity; affirmative action; access; equity
ID CRITICAL RACE THEORY; AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION; EDUCATION; POLICY
AB At the heart of the longstanding debate of addressing racial inequities in higher education is an argument about whether race should be a factor in admissions decisions. One argument is that institutions should be held accountable for diversity through external policies like affirmative action. Alternatively, there is the position that institutions will act in good faith to implement diversity goals. Through a critical discourse analysis of policy discourse from the Texas legislature regarding 2009 changes to the Texas Top Ten Percent Plan, findings suggest that there may be less emphasis on accountability for institutional diversification through external policy like affirmative action. Instead, policy focuses on individual institutional diversity efforts. Using Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a theoretical framework, our findings maintain that as interest convergence changes (as the power elite no longer see current admissions policy benefiting them), there may be stronger arguments for internal accountability for diversity, leaving diversity efforts up to the people within individual institutions. Implications for institutional accountability are further discussed.

DE equity; LGBT; PAR; sexual and gender diversity; university
AB Despite the numerous advances towards the recognition of LGBT rights worldwide, real equity has not yet been achieved. It is therefore necessary to take into consideration not only the socio-political context but also the concrete practices that have been developed in specific settings. The university represents an important scene, which generates knowledge and development in societies. This study, from a Liberating Community Psychology approach, analysed five good practices related to LGBT issues and psychology placed in four countries with different socio-cultural backgrounds: Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia and Spain. The results from an ecological SWOT analysis-based on interviews and questionnaires with diverse stakeholders and experts-showed the internal weaknesses (e.g., lack of resources) and strengths (e.g., high promoters' commitment, students acceptance) of the good practices, as well as their external opportunities and threats in the academic (e.g., social status of the university, curricula gaps), but also in the socio-political context (e.g., protecting policies, attacks from conservative sectors). Additionally, action-research proposals to improve equity in/from universities were suggested by stakeholders and prioritized by experts through a Delphi panel. The main theoretical and practical contributions are discussed. Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article's Community and Social Impact Statement.

AB Introduction: Undergraduate research experiences prepare students for graduate training or employment. Statement of problem: At many teaching-intensive universities, there is a greater demand for research experiences than there are independent study opportunities. Students from typically underrepresented backgrounds may also be unaware of a department's undergraduate research pipeline of independent study, honor's theses, and internal research funding. Literature review: Course-based research contributes to diversity and inclusivity in access to undergraduate research experiences, especially at teaching-intensive universities. Course-based research is often integrated into methods courses, but not content courses. Teaching implications: I present practical ways to integrate research projects into courses. I stress the importance of testing theory, teaching open-science practices, and providing opportunities for students to present professionally. I also provide examples of implementing group research projects in content courses. Conclusion: Implementing course-based research projects, especially at teaching-intensive universities, can expand access to psychological science by providing valuable research opportunities for many students. Instructors can also benefit by intertwining their teaching, mentoring, and research goals. Future research should focus on experimentally testing learning outcomes.

AB Background: Research highlights how high school near-peer mentors (HSNPMs) in outdoor school settings enhance younger students' programing experiences. Through this engagement, HSNPMs' critical consciousness (CC) of equity in outdoor and experiential education (OEEE) expands. Purpose: This article explores how HSNPMs develop CC of environmental and social justice in OEEE. Methodology/Approach: We used critical ethnography to understand how near-peer mentoring programing associated with equity, diversity, access, and inclusion (EDAI) develop CC, in OEEE. Findings/Conclusion: Intentionally developed training and curricula rooted in social justice education facilitate CC development. This training includes staff's facilitation of equity discussions and support of high school students' EDAI-related awareness, skills, and behaviors. Implications/Recommendations: HSNPMs contribute to EDAI in OEEE programs. We recommend including HSNPMs in staff training, program improvements, and planning activities.

LA English
DT Article
DE CORVI; local planning; neighbourhood quality of life; sustainable social
   housing; urban form
AB For a few decades, understanding land-use with integrated services and socially mixed groups has been considered vital to endure nature and societies in harmony. This article promotes inclusivity in planning neighbourhoods, by encouraging principles of urban form, towards a sustainable quality of life. In Chile, with the creation of SERVIU, homelessness was resolved by a quantitative approach of housing programs, promoting an exclusive urban expansion process, generating social segregation, and an over-concentration of precarious living conditions. Contrarily, in 1960 the focus of planning was oriented towards planning sustainable neighbourhoods under CORVI Programs, recognizing fundamental morphological principles. The aim of this article is to explore the spatial conditions and quality of life in neighbourhoods under SERVIU and CORVI programs, by evaluating elements of urban form. Elements to explore are: accessibility to services, commerce and recreation; vitality of social and commercial nodes; and diversity in land use and housing typology. Analising cases of Reina Sofia in the city of Valdivia and Rahue Bajo 2 in the city of Osorno, assessed through methods of People Following (Talen, 2011), Gates and Snapshot (Vaughan, 2001) and Simpsons Diversity Index - results show that CORVI programs include sustainable morphology in its urban form, which improves quality of life, in contrary to SERVIU Programs.

AB Webpages form a crucial interface between an organisation and the public and is often the first point-of-contact. For higher educational institutions such as universities, it forms an important portal to attract students and employees. From their overarching mission statements, to policy presentations, webpages can provide information regarding the basic milieu of a university. Therefore, it can be assumed that the language used in creating websites would reflect institutional attitudes on issues such as gender equity, diversity and inclusion.
   In this paper, we carry out a gender and diversity focused explanatory analysis on webpage content of 43 universities in Australia. The objective of this study is to identify the degree of gender/diversity friendly language used by universities, in presenting gender and diversity focused policy and procedures via webpages. The three-click rule was applied in deriving the relevant web content.
   Based on a general word analysis of the content, and existing gender and diversity literature, a 2-tierd word hierarchy was designed for further analysis. The thought underlying the two-tiered design is to differentiate between the more superficial language, related to gender equity and diversity policies (the upper tier) and the more functional language around individuals and their families (the lower tier). For example, university websites may present superficial information on the equity and diversity policies present, but may fail to present more intricate details regarding child-care, parental leave etc. The two-tiered word structure is designed to capture such differences.
   The upper tier consists of two clusters: words related to equity/diversity/inclusion (Equity word cluster) and words related to culture/sexuality and indigenous identity (CSI word cluster). The lower tier consists of one cluster encompassing words related to individual employees, partners, families and carers (Carer word cluster). Stage one of the analysis consisted of carrying out a comprehensive descriptive study of the Group of Eight (Go8) and Australian Technology Network (ATN) universities with regards to the weighted percentage of words for the three identified word clusters. Frequencies and weighted percentages for the word clusters were contrasted by groups (i.e. Go8 and ATN) and other explanatory variables (overall gender ratios, gender ratios by career grade/duties etc).
   Preliminary results suggest some differences in the language used around gender equity and diversity policies, both at the individual university level and groups. Reported means(+/- SD) of the weighted percentage for the Equity word cluster is 1.91(+/- 1.06) for Go8 universities and 3.49(+/- 4.19) for ATN while the reported means(+/- SD) of the weighted percentage for the CSI word cluster is 0.58 (+/- 0.57) for Go8 and 0.57 (+/- 0.51) for ATN. The reported means for the Carer word cluster is 2.77(+/- 1.70) for Go8 and 2.16(+/- 0.83) for ATN. Even with a low sample size (5), the relatively low standard deviation for the weighted percentage of the Carer related word cluster for ATN is noticeable. Differences in the mean weighted percentages for the 3 clusters based on the gender ratios was also observed. The second stage of the analysis extends this preliminary analysis to all 43 universities to identify various patterns that may exist between the gendered web language and institutional characteristics.

AB We undertake an investigation of public statements and pronouncements from leaders at various universities to gain insight into institutional values and environments relative to women and their participation and advancement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and other disciplinary fields. Employing content analysis techniques to focus on terminological use and keyword interdependencies in these speeches, our findings indicate that, while gender equality is addressed as a separate topic in its own right, university leaders raise issues of gender in the context of STEM participation primarily in conjunction only with other topics. As expected, the data also support arguments suggesting diversity in general as an important goal espoused in the rhetoric of university representatives. Questions remain, however, concerning whether these speeches presage concrete institutional commitments and responses relative to the achievement of diversity, gender equality, and gender equity in the STEM professoriate.

AB As cities increasingly engage in climate adaptation planning, many are seeking to promote public participation and facilitate the engagement of different civil society actors. Still, the variations that exist among participatory approaches and the merits and tradeoffs associated with each are not well understood. This article examines the experiences of Quito (Ecuador) and Surat (India) to assess how civil society actors contribute to adaptation planning and implementation. The results showcase two distinct approaches to public engagement. The first emphasizes participation of experts, affected communities, and a wide array of citizens to sustain broadly inclusive programmes that incorporate local needs and concerns into adaptation processes and outcomes. The second approach focuses on building targeted partnerships between key government, private, and civil society actors to institutionalize robust decision-making structures, enhance abilities to raise funds, and increase means to directly engage with local community and international actors. A critical analysis of these approaches suggests more inclusive planning processes correspond to higher climate equity and justice outcomes in the short term, but the results also indicate that an emphasis on building dedicated multi-sector governance institutions may enhance long-term programme stability, while ensuring that diverse civil society actors have an ongoing voice in climate adaptation planning and implementation.
   Policy relevance
   Many local governments in the Global South experience severe capacity and resource constraints. Cities are often required to devolve large-scale planning and decision-making responsibilities, such as those critical to climate adaptation, to different civil society actors. As a result, there needs to be more rigorous assessments of how civil society participation contributes to the adaptation policy and planning process and what local social, political, and economic factors dictate the way cities select different approaches to public engagement. Also, since social equity and justice are key indicators for determining the effectiveness and sustainability of adaptation interventions, urban adaptation plans and policies must also be designed according to local institutional strengths and civic capacities in order to account for the needs of the poor and most vulnerable. Inclusivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring equitable planning processes and just adaptation outcomes.

AB The recent growth in cycling in the United States has paralleled a growth in the diversity of cyclists, but what encourages people to bicycle is not the same across all demographic groups. This study uses intercept survey data from predominately Latino-immigrant neighborhoods to understand how social ecological motivations for cycling differ for immigrants and U.S.-born residents. Both perceptions of cycling and social relationships with cyclists are strong predictors of cycling, and more strongly so for immigrants. Planning that supports both social and physical infrastructure may help meet the needs of diverse cyclists and promote equity.

SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB In July 2020, the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine opened in Pasadena, California, with an inaugural class of 50 students. The school endeavors to address systemic barriers that have contributed to health care and educational disparities in the United States. To realize its vision for change, equity, inclusion, and diversity (EID) have been woven throughout the school. Board members were chosen in part based on their commitment to the core values of EID. The board developed mission, vision, and values statements that explicitly avow a commitment to EID and recruited a dean (and the dean recruited leaders) who espoused and evinced these values. Leaders, faculty, and staff received training to foster an inclusive environment and ensure accountability. The school developed a curriculum that has been thoroughly evaluated for its representative and inclusive content by a team drawn from all departments. The diverse first class, selected through a holistic admissions approach, has access to student support systems that emphasize an appreciation of the distinct experiences and context of each student. The school plans a rigorous evaluation program to assess its performance in EID. Although the school may well fall short of achieving all of its EID objectives, by learning from its experiences and from evidence of others in academic medicine, the school recognizes its opportunity to continue to come closer to achieving its goals and to help shape and contribute to the national and international discourse on EID.

AB Today libraries stand as the most inclusive institution in US society, but their workforces remain unaligned with the wide-ranging domestic demographic. With 83% of librarians identifying as white in 2020, this institution requires cultural reconstruction to enable its information literacy goals. As diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts have been unsuccessful over the years in libraries, this report surveys efforts in industries with more diverse workers and adapts them for implementation in library settings. Recruitment, retainment, and inclusion strategies in corporate, STEM, and healthcare environments are reviewed to identify successful options as starting points for library planners. Practical adaptations are provided as more feasible options for library budgets and personnel volumes. As libraries were founded and transformed to serve the varying needs of all patrons, incorporating these DEI tools into planning strategies is imperative to diversify library labor forces and eliminate barriers to information literacy

AB Public Significance Statement With declines in representation in the range of 50%-70%, diversity constriction of underrepresented minorities (i.e., Hispanic/Latinx; Black/African American individuals; Native American) is a pernicious problem within clinical psychology for which discipline-level remediation seems appropriate. Points of known constriction, such as doctoral recruitment and admissions and examination for licensure, are encouraged to learn from the more effective methods and processes of internship match to foster greater inclusiveness and equity.
   Racial and ethnic diversity constriction in the psychology training-to-workforce pipeline has been broadly identified at the undergraduate, graduate, and licensure levels. Within that context, the present study sought to investigate the rate at which racial and ethnic minority students matched for internship compared to majority non-Hispanic White graduate students. Consistent with prior reports, racial and ethnic minority students were significantly underrepresented in clinical psychology doctoral programs. However, internship match rates did not differ significantly by racial and ethnic minority status. Placed within the larger context of established literature, the findings suggest that internship match is not likely to be a significant contributor to the constriction of racial/ethnic diversity in the training-to-workforce pipeline. As an exception to the problem, other points in the training-to-workforce pipeline that have been identified as points of diversity constriction (e.g., doctoral recruitment and admissions, licensure) may benefit from careful consideration of internship application criteria and/or review processes in formulating constriction remediation plans. Programmatic remediation of underrepresented minorities can lead to several gains for the profession, including improved educational outcomes; improved leadership and critical thinking skills; and increased openness and tolerance for racial, cultural, and value diversity.

   MOBILITY; PLANS; SUSTAINABILITY; OBJECTIVES; EMPLOYMENT; INDICATORS
AB Purpose Transportation systems play a key role in providing individuals with a diversity of means to access their desired destinations and have significant impacts on their quality of life. The social perspective of mobility is, however, marginalized in the current model of transportation planning and significant changes are called for. This study aims to identify the barriers and opportunities of local participatory approaches to trigger changes in transportation planning in Montreal, drawing on the concept of social learning.
   Methods A case study approach is selected and the participatory processes of two Local Transportation Plans (LTPs) are analysed. Data is collected through document analysis and semi-structured interviews with local transport planners and representatives of community groups. A qualitative content analysis is conducted to assess the outcomes of public participation, the quality of the processes and the perspectives of participants.
   Results The results highlight the narrow contribution of the participation of local communities and community groups in the development of LTPs. Furthermore, the participatory process assessed in this research allows for a limited integration of social aspects in the planning process. The main barriers lie in the broader planning context and the organizational structure at the borough level as well as the lack of expertise of the community groups. Nevertheless, LTPs provide a window of opportunity for addressing transport-related social aspects.
   Conclusion In order to take advantage of this opportunity and foster social learning towards the desired changes, the process requires the inclusion of clear social equity goals at the metropolitan level. Furthermore, the presence of a skilled facilitator is key to support the integration of diverse perspectives on transportation planning. It is also essential to provide community groups with resources to meaningfully participate in the process, thereby promoting social equity. In sum, LTPs have the potential to further include the social dimension of transport, but further steps are required to foster an equitable and sustainable transportation system. This research is of relevance to researchers and planners wishing to better understand the challenges associated with participatory processes and social equity in transport planning.

AB The contribution discusses the work of the African Academy of Languages (ACALAN), initiated in 2001 by the president of the Republic of Mali and officially institutionalised in 2006 as a special office of the African Union. It starts off with a discussion of a number of issues relevant to language planning in Africa: the need to accept that African languages and the languages imposed on African communities in the colonial period have to co-exist; the potential of language to be used to serve elite interests; the importance of counter-hegemonic strategies; the threat posed to African languages by urban vernaculars; and the necessity of viewing language planning as an integral part of social and economic planning. Hereafter, the origin, objectives and structures of ACALAN are discussed. The article ends with an overview of ACALAN's core projects and initiatives, asking what the likelihood is that ACALAN will succeed if many similar initiatives have failed.

AB Prior to the mid-1970s, policy simply meant planning. Over time, policy studies have shifted from predominantly empirical approaches to more diverse methods emanating from postmodern and critical perspectives. More recently, the themes of equity, school choice, and social background (rather than meritocracy) have mixed with current discourses of centralization/deceiitralization, diversity/uniformity, and curriculum standardization in policy debate. The knowledge base of information technologies and resources held by school librarians can play a positive role in establishing successful policy frameworks for technology planning and implementation at school and district levels.

AB A critical need exists to address structural racism within academic and community medicine and surgery and determine methods that will serve to repair its long-standing effects and alleviate the associated negative consequences. Because of our broad skillset and the populations we serve, vascular surgeons are uniquely positioned to identify and address the effects of structural racism in our places of work and for the populations we treat. Our goal is to discuss the effects of racism on healthcare outcomes and provide recommendations on how to combat these through equitable practices such as the diversification of the vascular surgery workforce, inclusivity as partners and leaders, and the promotion of improved outcomes among our most vulnerable patients from racial and ethnic minority groups. It is imperative that we stand for antiracism within our field through our societies, journals, clinical trials, training programs, clinical practice groups, and leadership.

DT Article
DE Antiracism; diversity; equity; inclusion; publishing
AB Fueled by a recent groundswell of support, scholarly publishing organizations are formalizing their focus on equity and inclusion, yet there is still a lack of effective programs and solutions actually in place. A cross-organizational working group is developing antiracism toolkits (for organizations, for allies, and for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) to transform scholarly publishing workplaces and organizational cultures. The resources, which will be hosted at c4disc.org, provide a common framework for analysis, a shared vocabulary, best practices, and training materials to guide individuals and organizations as they address systemic inequities specific to the scholarly publishing community. Originally planned as a presentation at the NC Serials Conference in March 2020, this article introduces the toolkits and explains why an antiracist framework is essential to transforming scholarly publishing.

AB It is increasingly accepted that higher levels of excellence and innovation in research can be achieved by organizations that promote equity, diversity, and inclusion across several domains including ethnicity and gender. The purpose of this commentary is to provide an overview of the methods used to increase diversity within ACNP, as well as recommendations for accelerating progress. Annual membership surveys confirm increases in female membership and leadership positions, slower but encouraging signals for "Asian" and "Hispanic" members, and less progress for African American and other ethnic populations. Meetings have become visibly more diverse, due in part to ethnic minority travel awards and apparently increasing diversity among guest attendees. Evidence of increasing inclusion includes well-attended networking events and minority-relevant programming, active communications about diversity-related events and resources, and strong statements by ACNP leadership that embrace diversity as a core value and support collaboration among key committees and task forces to identify and implement pro-inclusion and diversity-enhancing efforts. We believe ACNP can accelerate progress with more scientifically valid approaches to assessing diversity and inclusion. The current membership survey includes five outmoded ethnic options and postmeeting surveys that are not designed to assess inclusion efforts and consequences. Measures should be developed that better characterize diversity and assess efforts to reduce the barriers that exist for potential non-White populations (e.g., annual membership and meeting attendance costs). Increased collaboration with NIH and other organizations that are committed to these same goals may also contribute to acceleration of progress by ACNP and other scientific organizations.

AB From an academic career in economic development planning, the author reflects on values, research styles, and connections to real-world planning and how these translate into change on the ground. Markusen argues that both an evolving normative framework (equity, diversity, democracy, efficiency, stability) and the tools of political economy have helped planners create good work. She credits the inclusion, from the 1950s on, of social scientists and other professionals such as lawyers and feminists into the planning academy for producing a vigorous interdisciplinary field. She demonstrates that choosing to focus your research on what bothers you most about planning thought and practice often results in powerful and widely read results and cites cases where advocacy research and outreach, including writing for multiple audiences, has produced positive change. Markusen ends with a reflection on the gifts of colleagueship.

AB National efforts to improve equitable teaching practices in biology education have led to an increase in research on the barriers to student participation and performance, as well as solutions for overcoming these barriers. Fewer studies have examined the extent to which the resulting data trends and effective strategies are generalizable across multiple contexts or are specific to individual classrooms, institutions, or geographic regions. To address gaps in our understanding, as well as to establish baseline information about students across contexts, a working group associated with a research coordination network (Equity and Diversity in Undergraduate STEM, EDU-STEM) convened in Las Vegas, Nevada, in November of 2019. We addressed the following objectives: 1) characterize the present state of equity and diversity in undergraduate biology education research; 2) address the value of a network of educators focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics equity; 3) summarize the status of data collection and results; 4) identify and prioritize questions and interventions for future collaboration; and 5) construct a recruitment plan that will further the efforts of the EDU-STEM research coordination network. The report that follows is a summary of the conclusions and future directions from our discussion.

AB LEED v4 for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND) is a neighborhood sustainability assessment tool developed through a collaborative effort between the United States Green Building Council, the Congress for the New Urbanism, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. LEED-ND utilizes a credit-based ratings system that serves as a template for the development of green, sustainable neighborhoods. This research study analyzes the locational and demographic attributes of 246 proposed, completed, and/or in progress LEED-ND sites to better understand whether LEED-ND and its ratings system are achieving its goal of promoting greater social equity. This study analyzes the temporal changes of eight demographic variables that are indicative of neighborhood gentrification. These variables include educational attainment, median income, median rent, median land values, household size, median age, percent non-white, and racial diversity. Statistically significant changes to educational attainment, median rent, and diversity were observed at various geographic levels. It was also determined that the effects of LEED-ND developments are likely felt beyond the physical boundaries of the sites. The findings suggest that LEED-ND developments may function as catalysts of neighborhood gentrification rather than promoting greater social equity.

AB Diversity is a core value of the American Library Association and diversity standards including cultural competencies have been adopted by the Association of College and Research Libraries. Nevertheless, academic libraries still have obstacles to overcome to embody these principles. Minorities continue to be underrepresented in the field and many encounter barriers within library cultures where cultural competency is lacking and micro aggressions are pervasive and invisible to many white colleagues. This study uses critical participatory action research to identify ways a library diversity and inclusion team can support library employees engaging in equity-minded work at a private, predominantly white Catholic university in the Midwest. The researchers developed a moderator guide, which they used to conduct focus groups with library faculty and staff. Library employees were asked to identify the challenges and opportunities for doing equity-minded work at the institution. What emerged from these conversations led to the development of four guiding principles. The guiding principles outlined are: a) engaging stakeholders; b) building relationships; c) modeling equity-minded practice; and d) demonstrating intercultural competence. These guiding principles are embedded in a critical theory of love as well as critical emotion and critical whiteness studies. These principles promote re-humanizing the ways in which library employees interact with each other and students while resisting the normalization of white cultural practices. Action item examples are offered to demonstrate how library employees can incorporate these principles into their practice. Finally, we offer our next steps moving forward as we plan to implement these guiding principles to support a climate of equity for library employees.

AB Prioritisation of cases and resources as a means of rationing the limited legal aid budget has recently become a feature of access to justice in the UK. This article explores the utility of devising proxy models of 'legal need' as a means of enabling the rational and equitable planning of legal services in these circumstances. Different conceptual and methodological approaches are considered, highlighting preliminary development work in Scotland. The likelihood of developing 'legal needs' measures that promote equity of access to appropriate legal services is discussed in the light of problems with defining 'legal need' and the diversity of services available for the resolution of legal problems.

AB This article aims to clarify the effect of generational diversity on the formulation of the need for green space. The reading tool adopted is the Shannon index. Its use was accompanied by the Richness Index (number of age groups) and the Equitability Index. However, the more varied and balanced composition of the population, the need for green space per inhabitant occupies a median position in terms of the need for green space per inhabitant. A "good diversity" in the sense of richness and equity is revealed among the ferments for a sustained presence and preservation of the plant element in development projects.

AB Our collective experience with COVID-19 and Black Lives Matter has heightened awareness of deeply embedded racial and socioeconomic disparities in American businesses. This time, perhaps, sustained change is within reach. As organizations advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, an often overlooked focus of is the health status of employees and their families, where equitable access to high-value health benefits offerings should be available to all. This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health-for lower income workers, in particular-with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity. The provided recommendations can support employer goals of achieving greater equity and value in workforce health, measurably contributing to business success.

ID ATTRITION
AB Background Local, regional, and national diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have been established to combat barriers to entry and promote retention in surgery residency programs. Our study evaluates changes in diversity in general surgery residency programs. We hypothesize that diversity trends have remained stable nationally and regionally. Materials and Methods General surgery residents in all postgraduate years were queried regarding their self-reported sex, race, and ethnicity following the 2020 ABSITE. Residents were then grouped into geographic regions. Data were analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-square analyses. Results A total of 9276 residents responded. Nationally, increases in female residents were noted from 38.0 to 46.0% (P < .001) and in Hispanic or Latinx residents from 7.3 to 8.3% (P = .031). Across geographic regions, a significant increase in female residents was noted in the Northwest (51.9 to 58.3%, P = .039), Midwest (36.9 to 43.3%, P = .006), and Southwest (35.8 to 47.5%, P = .027). A significant increase in black residents was only noted in the Northwest (0 to 15.8%, P = .031). The proportion of white residents decreased nationally by 8.9% and in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Southwest between 5.5 and 15.9% (P < .05). Discussion In an increasingly diverse society, expanding the numbers of underrepresented surgeons in training, and ultimately in practice, is a necessity. This study shows that there are region-specific increases in diversity, despite minimal change on a national level. This finding may suggest the need for region-specific DEI strategies and initiatives. Future studies will seek to evaluate individual programs with DEI plans and determine if there is a correlation to changing demographics.

AB This study examined 32 university presidents' responses to the violence that occurred during and after a 'Unite the Right' white supremacist rally in Charlottesville Virginia in August 2017. The purpose of this study was to explore how university presidents provided leadership during this crisis and how they did or did not utilise sensemaking to guide their communities. Findings revealed that presidents' primary foci were to reassure their communities, express solidarity with those in Charlottesville, review First Amendment rights, and emphasise that their campuses were not places for hatred. Additionally, it was noted that few presidents actually named the victims of the Charlottesville violence or addressed the systemic racism that contributed to the violence.

AB Recognizing that racism has profound effects on persons who use alcohol and other drugs, the Association for Multidisciplinary Education and Research in Substance use and Addiction (AMERSA) commits to promoting equity and inclusion to dismantle the individual, institutional, and structural racism that has pervaded the United States for centuries. Racism's deadly effects compounded with other social determinants of health result in a cascade of negative impacts. These include higher rates of incarceration, increased risk of overdose, fewer employment options, multi-generational poverty and economic disadvantage for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPoC). The AMERSA Board of Directors (BOD) proposes an initial set of strategies to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion using a framework that speaks to four key AMERSA experiences: engagement, education, mentorship, and leadership.

AB Professional computing organisations, including the ACM, IEEE and INFORMS published statements supporting Black Lives Matter during the 2020 racial unrest in the United States. While the voices of these professional organisations are echoed from positions of power, the concerns of Black IS professors are silenced. In this opinion piece, we centre on the voices of Black professors who seek to thrive in an IS field where they are woefully underrepresented, tokenized, isolated, marginalised and excluded from positions of power. Building on the Black Lives Matter movement's momentum, we offer critical insights about our lived experiences and examine pertinent issues. These issues include systemic racism in the ivory tower and the performative nature of diversity work in the academy. In direct response to the Help the Association of Information Systems (AIS) Build a System that Provides Equality for All, we offer an inclusive framework for promoting transparency, justification, compliance and enforcement of the AIS's action plan for widening participation in IS.

AB This article contends examines how racialization - the strategic employment of racial discourses to both define- and legitimize-specific social and spatial changes - serves as an adaptive and strategic means for city leaders and developers to control, define, plan and implement efforts to reshape impoverished neighborhoods. The deployment of racial tropes and narratives, such as diversity and social mix', organize and make legible redevelopment and its consequences of displacement for communities of poor minority residents. Urban development initiatives are imagined, worked out, legitimated and reconciled in an urban politics that relies on the deployment of racialized discourses of colorblindness, inclusivity and diversity. Drawing on a case study of redevelopment of Regent Park in Toronto, Canada, the paper examines how minorities are placed in the position of combatting socioeconomic and spatial inequalities, including displacement, on racial terms set by white elites.

AB What happens to race in public discussions about "race-neutral" college admissions policies? This article shows how race disappeared from elite political debate during hearings on Texas Senate Bill 175 (2009), the Top Ten Percent Plan (the Plan), which guaranteed college admissions to high school graduates from the top 10% of their classes. Findings indicated that race disappeared from the discussion of college admissions policy in Texas. Instead, policy makers emphasized students' opportunity to compete for college admissions ignoring that the opportunities for and impediments to success at different high schools varied widely across the state. The implication of these findings is that as policy becomes race neutral, discourse also becomes "colorblind" potentially disguising structural and secondary school inequalities.

The pace and scope of technology as a force for problem solving, connecting people, sharing information, and organizing civic life has increased in the wake of COVID-19. This article critically reviews how technology use influences the civic engagement potential of the smart city, in particular for people with disabilities. The article aims to articulate new challenges to virtual participation in civic life in terms of accessibility, usability, and equity. Next, the article proposes a framework for a smart participation future involving smarter communities that utilize universal design, blended bottom-up, and virtual community of practice (VCoP) approaches to planning and connecting citizens with disabilities to smart cities. Policy and ethical implications of the proposed smart participation future are considered.

AB As the popularity of New Urbanism has grown, local governments have attempted to translate New Urbanist planning components into planning policy forms. Through observation of comprehensive plans in 40 cities in Florida, this paper explores the extent to which New Urbanism principles are embedded in terms of factual basis, goals, tools, intergovernmental coordination, and implementation. The outcomes of this study indicate that (1) the total quality of the plans varies by city; (2) local governments are well aware of the importance of New Urbanism; (3) there are weak links between the evaluation categories of factual basis and goals; (4) goals and objectives are addressed most effectively; (5) diversity and equity are relatively less addressed; and (6) proactive tools (e.g. form-based codes, transect zoning, or urban growth boundaries) are limited. The outcomes of this study are expected to benefit cities and improve their future plans by allowing the effective integration of New Urbanism depending on their own priorities.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine whether board gender diversity and other board characteristics affect earnings management practices of top public companies in Kazakhstan. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes data of top public companies for the period 2010-2016. Data on corporate governance were manually collected from annual reports and investment memorandums, and financial data were collected from audited financial statements. Findings The empirical results show that companies with greater board gender diversity are more effective in constraining earnings management. The findings also indicate that companies with larger boards adopt a more restrained approach to earnings management practices, thus supporting the theoretical framework of the study. However, the results provide weak evidence of the association between board independence and earnings quality. Originality/value This study is the first to investigate the relationship between gender diversity and earnings management in emerging markets such as Kazakhstan that offers managerial and policy implications.

AB Results of two C-Change surveys of 4997 faculty and staff in medical and social sciences are analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and presented with illustrative quotations giving voice to critical personal perceptions of the culture and efforts to improve it. The C-Change survey included 12 dimensions of the culture: Vitality; Self-Efficacy in Career Advancement; Institutional Support; Relationships/Inclusion/Trust; Values Alignment; Ethical/Moral Distress; Leadership Aspirations; Work-Life Integration; Gender Equity; Black and Minority Ethnic Equity; Institutional Change Efforts for Diversity; Institutional Change Efforts for Faculty Support. Women were less positive than men on six dimensions in medical and ten dimensions in social sciences, suggesting that women's experiences are different to those of men. Both women and men were more positive about the culture in medical than social sciences. A more positive culture in medical sciences is attributed to the wide-spread implementation of Athena SWAN gender equality action plans linked to the NIHR funding incentives.

AB The importance of advancing equity, diversity, and inclusion for all members of the academic medical community has gained recent attention. Academic medical organizations have attempted to increase broader representation while seeking structural reforms consistent with the goal of enhancing equity and reducing disproportionality. However, efforts remain constrained while minority groups continue to experience discrimination. In this study, the authors sought to identify and understand the discursive effects of discrimination policies within medical education. The authors assembled an archive of 22 texts consisting of publicly available discrimination and harassment policy documents in 13 Canadian medical schools that were active as of November 2019. Each text was analysed to identify themes, rhetorical strategies, problematization, and power relations. Policies described truth statements that appear to idealize equity, yet there were discourses related to professionalism and neutrality that were in tension with these ideals. There was also tension between organizations' framing of a shared responsibility for addressing discrimination and individual responsibility on complainants. Lastly, there were also competing discourses on promoting freedom from discrimination and the concept of academic freedom. Overall, findings reveal several areas of tension that shape how discrimination is addressed in policy versus practice. Existing discourses regarding self-protection and academic freedom suggest equity cannot be advanced through policy discourse alone and more substantive structural transformation may be necessary. Existing approaches may be inadequate to address discrimination unless academic medical organizations interrogate the source of these discursive tensions and consider asymmetries of power.

AB Health and well-being have become important dimensions of urban sustainability, particularly in countries with rapid urbanization and aging populations. As such, providing opportunities for physical activity and exercise has become a priority in the planning and governance of Healthy City in these countries. Relatively little research has investigated the provision of sports facilities in developing countries. This paper seeks to address this gap by exploring the spatial and social inequality of sports facilities at the urban scale using Nanning City in South China as a case study. Spatial aggregate analyses, including an allocation index, accessibility, diversity, and geographically weighted regression, were applied to mixed data sets from primary and secondary sources from 2018. The results confirmed a strong inequality of sports facilities provision across the study area and between age groups. This study suggests that the reduction of inequality and the improvement of equity and social justice should consider the spatial and social matches between demand and supply, through increasing sports facilities investment intensity and road network density.

AB Equity in the promotion of women and underrepresented minorities (URiM) is essential for the advancement of academic emergency medicine and the specialty as a whole. Forward-thinking healthcare organizations can best position themselves to optimally care for an increasingly diverse patient population and mentor trainees by championing increased diversity in senior faculty ranks, leadership, and governance roles. This article explores several potential solutions to addressing inequities that hinder the advancement of women and URiM faculty. It is intended to complement the recently approved American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) policy statement aimed at overcoming barriers to promotion of women and URiM faculty in academic emergency medicine. This policy statement was jointly released and supported by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM), and the Association of Academic Chairs of Emergency Medicine (AACEM).

The research uses data from organisational reports submitted to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency in order to identify issues in one industry, and line organisational approach to equal opportunity with the employment status of women. Despite the high numbers of women employed in this female-dominated industry, there are limited numbers of women in management. The findings show no correlation between the equal opportunity approach used and numbers of women in management.

AB I propose a framework motivated by the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis (AMH) to analyze the relevance of a specific information source for the trading of a given security. To illustrate the applicability and advantages of this methodology, I explore the extent to which the financial statement (FS) is relevant for Credit Default Swap (CDS) trading. Specifically, I adopt a Bayesian Model Averaging approach to examine properties of the accounting metrics that enter the implied trading heuristics of the market participants. Hypothesis-testing is conducted on various horizons around the announcement dates of corporate results. The diversity of trading rules and the shift in the heuristics mix that occurred after 2008 support the AMH perspective. Overall, results show that there is a significant component of profit-motivated trading in the CDS market that relies on financial statement information, even after controlling for information transmission from alternative trading forums. Out of sample trading strategies confirm the robustness the main findings.

AB Diversity is a concept that Jane Jacobs places at the heart of her work and that Susan Fainstein similarly identifies as central to the definition of a just city. But what is the relationship between the diversity in the built environment that Jacobs emphasizes and the socio-economic diversity that Fainstein notes is so important? Drawing on Jacobs and Fainstein to analyze a case study of an affordable housing development in Boston, Massachusetts, we argue that planning with a just city in mind requires more than a commitment to diversity in urban form or demographic composition. Instead of setting out diversity as a goal that may help dominant individuals overcome irrational prejudices through the free flow of ideas when exposed to diverse peers, we argue for policies that identify and address historical inequalities and relations of domination along the lines of sex, sexuality, race, ethnicity, national origin, or other ascriptive characteristics.

AB Purpose Using agency theory and impression management theory, this study examines the impact of financial performance (FP) and corporate governance (CG) mechanisms on the extent of intellectual capital disclosures (ICDs) and the three components within the CEO statement - human capital (HC), structural capital (SC) and relational capital (RC). Design/methodology/approach This study employs a sample of non-financial SPF-120 French listed firms to capture the relevant variables; it collects data for 2010-2017, using a panel data technique to run the random effects regressions. Findings The study finds that FP, measured using both market (Tobin's q) and accounting (return on equity and return on assets) indicators, plays a vital role in the extent of ICDs and the three components in the CEO statement published by SPF-120 companies. This confirms its impact on the decision-making needs of stakeholders. Among the CG mechanisms, this study finds that cultural diversity and gender diversity affect some ICD components. Moreover, CEO characteristics such as age, education and role duality affect ICD, while institutional ownership drives the extent of such disclosures. Practical implications Our findings have comprehensive implications for managers of French listed firms, the Autorite des Marches Financiers, and stakeholders in general. Originality/value This study provides significant insights by investigating the impact of FP, CG and company characteristics on the extent of the ICDs published in CEO statements.

AB This commentary focuses on the article "Graduate Debt in Psychology: A Quantitative Analysis" by Doran, Kraha, Marks, Ameen, and El-Ghoroury (2016), which was published in a previous issue of Teaching and Education in Professional Psychology. In this response, we discuss the importance of legitimizing the severity of the student debt problem within the field, current work from the APA/APAGS to reduce student debt, and propose a plan for addressing graduate student debt, which includes the 7 following areas: (a) transparency and guidance for undergraduate psychology students, (b) financial informed consent in graduate training, (c) ensuring financial literacy and creating a culture of safety around discussing student debt, (d) postgraduation financial resources, (e) Increasing Funding Opportunities For Clinical Training, (f) federal advocacy for student debt concerns, and (g) APA advocacy for higher wages for entry-level positions. Each area is described with examples of implementation. We conclude our commentary with a discussion of how graduate student debt may affect diversity, inclusivity, and social justice within professional psychology.

AB During the past several years, various writers and commentators have argued that as part of their affirmative action efforts, universities should enroll more students of working-class origins because socioeconomic integration ensures greater social equity, democracy, and intellectual diversity. The present study shows that the justifications applied to student diversity pertain equally well to professors. This discussion proposes that if public administration were first to use socioeconomic status-based affirmative in faculty hiring, it would prove the discipline's willingness to meet its self-imposed obligation to be cutting edge, a promise studies have shown it has yet to fulfill.

AB Learning trajectory (LT) research in mathematics education has shaped both instructional materials and assessments. But, the body of LT research has also been critiqued for not adequately considering equity and addressing student diversity. This study begins to fill this gap by characterizing the reasoning of 23 multilingual students who participated in task-based interviews about proportional relationships and linear functions. Using tasks aligned with an established LT, the analysis focuses on the interaction of task language demand and student language background. Results show how task linguistic complexity can interfere with accurately interpreting the mathematical reasoning of emergent bilingual students. We discuss the need to (a) incorporate a focus on linguistic diversity when planning instruction and (b) broaden the students who participate in LT research to avoid reinforcing implicitly biased assumptions about diverse learners.

ID RIGHT-WING POPULISM; POLITICS; PARTY; CRITIQUE; BACK; CITY; STOP
AB The purpose of this article is to offer planning scholars a basis for criticizing authoritarian populism and not limiting ideological critique to neoliberalism. Authoritarian populism is anti-elitist, anti-pluralist and excluding in that the authentic people includes only part of the population. Authoritarian populists imagine a homogeneous people whose will determines policy. The article deals with confrontations and contact points between communicative planning theory and populist currents. It distils several core themes from five authoritative collections of works on planning theory and examines their relations with populist ideas. Authoritarian populism is an incomplete ideology that can fuse with various other ideologies. Amalgamations of populism and neoliberalism pose new challenges to participatory planning. Authoritarian populism criticizes planning institutions for blocking the immediate realization of the will of the people and being sympathetic to social diversity and cultural influence threatening heartland values. Neoliberalism is opposed to the welfare policies, equity goals, growth restrictions and other public interventions associated with spatial planning. Joint pressure from the two ideologies may alter the planning of liberal democracies in an autocratic direction.

AB Since Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education et al., school districts seeking to voluntarily integrate schools have designed a host of metrics to structure within-school diversity using characteristics of students' neighborhoods rather than the race of individual students. This study utilizes a correlational-multiple regression design to investigate the efficacy of one such measure of socioeconomic/racial diversity, the diversity index (DI) of Jefferson County Public Schools, in predicting the aggregate academic achievement of students within a school. Moreover, this study seeks to compare the relative efficacy of the DI with other common measures of socioeconomic and racial diversity analogous to component factors of the DI. Metrics such as the DI provide an opportunity for researchers to better understand the intersections of poverty and race as well as their relationship with academic achievement. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

AB Transgender and gender-expansive students are disproportionately at risk for a host of negative academic and health outcomes; yet, few educators receive training on gender-inclusive school practices. This descriptive study used evaluation survey data from employees (N = 1,425) across 80 schools participating in gender-inclusivity professional development sessions. Using a mixed-methods approach, we assessed educators' beliefs about the need and relevance of the training, capacity to improve learning environments, intended implementation of strategies, and suggestions for future trainings. We examined outcomes using descriptive statistics and assessed the educators' roles using regression analyses with- and without school fixed-effects. Our results showed educators wanted even more training on gender diversity and believed the professional development provided was useful and relevant. They reported having increased capacity to create a safe educational environment and discuss gender issues with others in their school environment. We found differences by educators' roles in schools and across schools in how capable educators felt in engaging parents, relevance to self, and usefulness. Future trainings and research should address these differences. The findings from this study provide a description of educators' responses to gender-diversity trainings from 80 schools, highlighting the broad relevance of and need for educator gender-diversity professional development.

AB The urban hospital workplace is a dynamic environment that mirrors the cultural and social diversity of the modern city. This paper explores the literature relating to diversity in the workplace and then describes an urban Canadian teaching hospital's comprehensive approach to the promotion of an equitable and inclusive diverse environment. With this goal, four years ago the hospital established an office of Diversity and Human Rights staffed by a social worker. The office provides education, training, policy development and complaints managennent. The administration also convened a hospital-wide committee to advise on the outcomes, and to plan a process for diversity and human rights organizational change. The committee worked with a social work research consultant to design a qualitative focus group study, currently ongoing, to explore the perspectives of hospital staff. The lessons learned from the process have the potential to increase overall cultural competency of staff that can translate into more sensitive work with patients.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION
AB Against a global pandemic, student care is in sharp focus for higher education institutions (HEIs) as students and institutions learn to navigate this context. Despite this, tensions exist between approaches to care and its value in HEIs. The neoliberalism underpinning HEIs results in the practice of care often being minimised. This is problematic as care is significant for its impact on student experiences. To demonstrate care, beyond simply service delivery, it is critical to develop a relational approach, especially for students who are already part of equity groups. The care demonstrated for these students has become more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this paper focuses on Pacific and International students. We discuss the challenges negotiating how to demonstrate care when care is undefined and undervalued. Adding to the complexity, gaps continue in practice despite broad statements made by HEIs regarding cultural inclusivity. We describe our experiences as care practitioners before and during the pandemic in HEIs in Aotearoa New Zealand and the United States (U.S.), what informs our practice, and how we negotiate barriers. Employing talanoa and thematic analysis, we identified commonalities in our experiences. There was a clear gap in institutional definitions of care and understanding approaches by care practitioners. For us, a strong relational approach to care is paramount to effective practice, and even more so during a pandemic; however, this is contrasted by the many tensions described. Finally, we recognise the opportunities that arose from the pandemic for innovation focusing on student equity, which must continue post-pandemic.

AB Purpose This study examines comprehensiveness and responsiveness of mission statements for the top 100 retailers on the 2020 National Retailers Federation list in order to (1) evaluate how effectively they communicate organizational identity, values and purpose, (2) underscore a distinctive commitment to stakeholders and (3) what extent these efforts are reflected in revised mission statements or addenda to meet global pandemic challenges. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a 4-question metric to measure comprehensiveness and a two-pronged qualitative method of analysis consisting of keyword searches followed by content analysis. Findings Retailer statements are considerably comprehensive in describing purpose and audience yet very few articulate stakeholder value, differentiate themselves as distinctive or substantively reaffirm their core mission and values. Retailers seem more invested in strategic communication around diversity, equity and inclusion, based on web content in their consumer, job seeker and investor touchpoints. Research limitations/implications Coding and interpreting language through content analysis methods may introduce some level of subjectivity, particularly when dealing with unstructured data. Implications for how organizations acclimated in order to survive and thrive, while maintaining focus on stakeholders and strategy. Examining organizational mission statements and their contexts yields perspective into how organizations define themselves and what they do during times of crisis. Originality/value This study provides insights into the content, structure and functions of the statements against a specific comprehensiveness metric and reveals patterns about the texts and their contexts during a pandemic and strong cultural and societal movements.

AB Despite tremendous investment to promote gender equity, U.S. public accounting firms continue to be gendered organizations. Our archival study examines gender equity within the partnership of these large firms for a one-year period. We find female partners are clustered in lower prestige client types including investment funds, benefit plans, and single audits, rather than higher prestige public company clients. Second, we consider whether there is gender bias in prestige of client served by female partners who lead public company audits. In these tests of those individuals who have already achieved the partnership and lead public company audits, we find no evidence of bias. This research contributes to the understanding of gender bias in U.S. public accounting firms and helps inform the societal narrative on where women continue to be marginalized even when they have achieved the highest levels in an organization.

AB Universal electrification by 2030 is an important goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. Electricity provision no longer relies only on centralized grid expansion, but also on off-grid and mini-grid systems. Although this technological diversity holds promise, the technologies differ both physically and institutionally in electricity delivery. These differences raise equity and justice concerns around how they are implemented. For example, how can electricity be kept affordable for all consumers when access is provided by various technologies operated under different business models? This paper addresses this aspect of affordability and sheds light on how the SDG7 target could be met more equitably and fairly. We use a novel analytical methodology to apply two different principles of justice - equality and equity - to incorporate affordability into electricity pricing. Using a geospatial electrification model and Tanzania as a case study, we first arrive at price levels based on the principle(s) of justice. Then, we produce location-specific recommendations for subsidy levels needed to ensure those price levels. We find that the equity approach benefits a bigger section of the population than the equality approach. Moreover, the former costs significantly less per capita than the latter. Having said that, the equity approach is complex and therefore harder to implement. The methodological framework proposed in this study acts as a proof-of-concept for examining concerns around distributive justice using quantitative energy modelling tools and drawing policy relevant insights for energy planning in developing countries. Additionally, by focusing on the spatial aspects of energy access and the issue of fairness, the study also contributes to the growing conceptualizations of energy justice.

AB This systematic review of recent research explored the uncharted intersection of literature on educational leadership, professional learning, and educational equity. It investigated leadership approaches to shaping the professional development and ongoing learning of educators which supports more equitable outcomes for students. The underlying motivation for the work is our concern for the educational experiences and achievements of marginalised students, and for professional learning to address these inequalities. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement, and iterative selection of literature based on relevance and quality judged by the weight of evidence assessments, we identified 41 empirical items for detailed analysis. The outcome was five themes: Critical framing of social justice issues; Dialogue and enquiry; Learning and identity development; Context, resources, and motivations; Normalising inclusion and shared leadership. A further six articles informed a conceptual framework linking professional learning and outcomes that developed existing models. Critique of linear conceptualisations of learning, and affinity with the values and philosophy of the process model of education championed by Lawrence Stenhouse, prompted proposing the themes as nascent principles. These require further research, yet they have immediate practical utility for educational leaders and teachers working in pursuit of educational equity.

AB The Association of Academic Physiatrists convened a Women's Task Force in 2016, under the leadership of then Association of Academic Physiatrists President Gerard Francisco, MD, to evaluate data and metrics pertaining to the representation and inclusion of female physiatrists in the society. An initial published report focused on a retrospective analysis of data in categories such as leadership, conference presentations, and recognition awards. The findings, which highlighted areas in which the Association of Academic Physiatrists had been successful in supporting gender equity as well as areas in which female physiatrists were underrepresented, provided a base from which to strategically focus on closing gaps in representation. The task force developed an action plan that was approved by the Board of Trustees and included strategies aimed at closing gaps and collecting data to determine corresponding effectiveness. Because most of the categories fell under the supervision of various Association of Academic Physiatrists committees, an appointee from each committee ("diversity steward") liaised with the Women's Task Force. The diversity stewards reviewed the plan with their respective committees and collected data within their committee's purview. This task force follow-up report documents recent progress, consistent with the Association of Academic Physiatrists Board of Trustees commitment to transparency and gender equity.

   disease; congestive heart failure; stroke; diabetes
ID DISPARITIES
AB Introduction: In all countries people experience different social circumstances that result in avoidable differences in health. In New Zealand, Maori, Pacific peoples, and those with lower socioeconomic status experience higher levels of chronic illness, which is the leading cause of mortality, morbidity and inequitable health outcomes. Whilst the health system can enable a fairer distribution of good health, limited national data is available to measure health equity. Therefore, we sought to find out whether health services in New Zealand were equitable by measuring the level of development of components of chronic care management systems across district health boards. Variation in provision by geography, condition or ethnicity can be interpreted as inequitable.
   Methods: A national survey of district health boards (DHBs) was undertaken on macro approaches to chronic condition management with detail on cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and diabetes. Additional data from expert informant interviews on program reach and the cultural needs of Maori and Pacific peoples was sought. Survey data were analyzed on dimensions of health equity relevant to strategic planning and program delivery.
   Results are presented as descriptive statistics and free text. Interviews were transcribed and NVivo 8 software supported a general inductive approach to identify common themes. Results: Survey responses were received from the majority of DHBs (15/21), some PHOs (21/84) and 31 expert informants. Measuring, monitoring and targeting equity is not systematically undertaken. The Health Equity Assessment Tool is used in strategic planning but not in decisions about implementing or monitoring disease programs. Variable implementation of evidence-based practices in disease management and multiple funding streams made program implementation difficult. Equity for Maori is embedded in policy, this is not so for other ethnic groups or by geography. Populations that conventional practitioners find hard to reach, despite recognized needs, are often underserved. Nurses and community health workers carried a disproportionate burden of care. Cultural and diversity training is not a condition of employment.
   Conclusions: There is a struggle to put equity principles into practice, indicating will without enactment. Equity is not addressed systematically below strategic levels and equity does not shape funding decisions, program development, implementation and monitoring. Equity is not incentivized although examples of exceptional practice, driven by individuals, are evident across New Zealand.

AB As school psychologists, we have an ethical responsibility to engage in social justice and antiracist action. School psychology organizations and graduate education programs play an important role in shaping future generations of school psychologists to lead the mental health, educational and research, and advocacy initiatives that promote equity for school personnel, students, families and communities they serve. This is only possible if our field acknowledges, evaluates, and works to reconstruct existing systems, structures, and policies that lead to inequitable outcomes for some groups and not others. "How can the school psychology community serve the diverse society in which we live without explicit and intentional education and growth in this area?" To help answer this question, APA Division 16, Trainers of School Psychologists, Council of Directors of School Psychology Programs, Society for the Study of School Psychology, the American Board of School Psychology, and the National Association of School Psychologists have come together to reaffirm our commitment to ensure current and future school psychologists are empowered to be antiracist agents of change. Impact Statement School Psychology's commitment and mission to advance research, practice, policy and advocacy for education continues. In light of this tragedy, we have a sharpened focus to reduce systemic racism and inequities in schools and communities across our nation. We must take affirmative action through active antiracist work.

AB Gender inequality is a widespread organizational challenge, however, research on gender in the workplace suffers from stagnation in mainstream management research. A positive work and organizations perspective has the capacity to augment problem-focused gender research with new approaches to boosting gender equity. Yet, contributions that utilize such a perspective are sparsely spread across nearly two decades' time and dozens of journals with differing disciplinary foci. This paper aims to reinvigorate gender research in management research by consolidating insights that have emerged through the application of a positive perspective. Therefore, we systematically review articles published in 21 management and psychological journals between 2001 and 2016. Four main themes emerged as drivers of gender research from a positive perspective: performance, social integration, well-being, and justice/moral matters. The contributions within these themes highlight pathways to organizational flourishing through positive diversity and inclusion behaviors and practices. Thus, this paper provides a conceptual map for navigating and planning further research.

TI THE PROMISE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND STANDARDS IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF EQUAL
   EDUCATIONAL-OPPORTUNITY
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The recent history of development in accountability in a variety of educational settings is discussed.  Focus is on the national standards for educational achievement and the complexity of the problems in setting those standards.  Among these complexities are issues that flow from the facts of diversity in the populations served by these institutions, and pluralism in the standards students must meet.  In response to the considerable confusion around much of the policy planning as concerns these issues, emphasis is given to definitional clarity relative to constructs like diversity, pluralism, and equity.  Attention is called to the ways in which chauvinism and communicentric bias may compromise the development and implementation of equitable systems of educational assessment that may also be universally applied.

TI Promoting High-Quality Cancer Care and Equity Through Disciplinary
   Diversity in Team Composition
SO JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID PATIENT NAVIGATION; BREAST; DIAGNOSIS
AB Disciplinary diversity in team composition is a valuable vehicle for oncology care teams to provide high-quality, person-centered comprehensive care. Such diversity facilitates care that effectively addresses the complex needs ( biologic, psychosocial, and spiritual) of the whole person. The concept of professional or disciplinary diversity centers on differences in function, education, and culture, reflecting variety and heterogeneity in the perspectives of team members contributing to care. Thorough understanding of the skills, knowledge, and education related to each team member's professional or lay expertise is critical for members to be able to optimize the team's potential. Furthermore, respect and appreciation for differences and similarities across disciplinary cultures allow team members to create a positive collaboration dynamic that maintains a focus on the care of the person with cancer. We present a case study of one oncology team's provision of care to the patient, a Chinese immigrant woman with breast cancer. The case illuminates the strengths and challenges of disciplinary diversity in team composition in assessing and addressing potential barriers to care. Coordinated sharing of information among the varied team members facilitated understanding and care planning focused on the patient's concerns, needs, and strengths. Importantly, collaboration across the disciplinarily diverse set of team members facilitated high-quality oncology care and promoted equity in access to the full range of care options, including enrollment on a National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trial. Further implications of disciplinary diversity in oncology care teams are considered for both clinical practice and research.

TI Social Accountability Frameworks and Their Implications for Medical

   HEALTH; IMPACT; SCHOOLS; CONTRACT; COMMUNITY; PHYSICIAN; SELECTION;
   TRANSPARENCY
AB Purpose
   Medical schools face growing pressures to produce stronger evidence of their social accountability, but measuring social accountability remains a global challenge. This narrative review aimed to identify and document common themes and indicators across large-scale social accountability frameworks to facilitate development of initial operational constructs to evaluate social accountability in medical education.
   Method
   The authors searched 5 electronic databases and platforms and the World Wide Web to identify social accountability frameworks applicable to medical education, with a focus on medical schools. English-language, peer-reviewed documents published between 1990 and March 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Primary source social accountability frameworks that represented foundational values, principles, and parameters and were cited in subsequent papers to conceptualize social accountability were included in the analysis. Thematic synthesis was used to describe common elements across included frameworks. Descriptive themes were characterized using the context-input-process-product (CIPP) evaluation model as an organizational framework.
   Results
   From the initial sample of 33 documents, 4 key social accountability frameworks were selected and analyzed. Six themes (with subthemes) emerged across frameworks, including shared values (core social values of relevance, quality, effectiveness, and equity; professionalism; academic freedom and clinical autonomy) and 5 indicators related to the CIPP model: context (mission statements, community partnerships, active contributions to health care policy); inputs (diversity/ equity in recruitment/selection, community population health profiles); processes (curricular activities, community-based clinical training opportunities/learning exposures); products (physician resource planning, quality assurance, program evaluation and accreditation); and impacts (overall improvement in community health outcomes, reduction/prevention of health risks, morbidity/mortality of community diseases).
   Conclusions
   As more emphasis is placed on social accountability of medical schools, it is imperative to shift focus from educational inputs and processes to educational products and impacts. A way to begin to establish links between inputs, products, and impacts is by using the CIPP evaluation model.

The present study is a territorial analysis and diagnosis process is carried out to improve pedestrian accessibility in the public space immediately to Teodoro Maldonado Hospital in Guayaquil through the development of a mobility plan for the establishment of design strategies. A mixed methodology is proposed under a systemic approach where six components are considered in the Jan Gehl methodology on five areas of action: Preservation of Heritage, Sustainable Mobility, Equity and Diversity, Urban Design at the Human Scale, Development Economic and Cultural. The proposal considers a higher level of importance (70%) for pedestrian circulation than the road system, following the parameters established in NACTO (National Association of transport officials of the city).

AB The purpose of this study was to examine factors that may influence the projected career plans of elementary general music teachers. Survey participants (N = 972) completed a questionnaire designed to elicit responses about multiple factors and projected career plans in 1 year and in 5 years. The vast majority of participants planned to remain in their position the following year, yet a little under half of them planned on remaining in their positions in 5 years. The variables associated with teacher migration or attrition in 5 years were issues of teacher support (i.e., participation in a mentoring program and recognition in the form of teaching awards), student race, and family responsibilities (i.e., number of children at home). Movers were also more likely to have received a teaching award than those who intended to stay in their current positions or those who planned to leave the profession. Implications for the profession as well as for practice and future research are discussed.

AB More historically White institutions of higher education are compelled to respond, in some way, to increased activism and awareness of continued legacies of racism and racial crises on campuses. The author suggests that how schools wrestle with their legacies of racism and/or respond to student demands to right racial wrongs on campus might be considered university acts of racial redress. Through a Critical Race Theory inspired chronicle, the author argues that seemingly positive university acts of racial redress such as policies, place un/naming, or public statements are, in fact, Racial Symbols that do little to change the material realities of racially marginalized people on campus.

AB Promoting diversity is core for ecological restoration. Restoration projects often quantify biological diversity as a measure of success, but generally overlook human diversity, including gender issues, which have not been sufficiently considered in restoration planning, implementation, and monitoring. Here, we justify the need to consider gender equality in ecological restoration and offer guidance on adopting gender-responsive approaches. Gender equality should be considered both a driver and a measure of success and will play a central role to leverage the contributions of restoration to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and of women to its Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. We finally recommend that the International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration are amended to include a gender-responsive perspective in its recommendations.

AB The Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) course has been fully active for 2 years, garnering a large group of diverse students [2], and flaming the need for highly trained CSP teachers, especially in effective practices for diversity and equity. We have conducted summer professional development (PD) workshops from 2012-2018 which have prepared 748 teachers to teach AP CSP using the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) curriculum. To improve equity and readiness for teaching, we have refined our PD by: shortening the PD from 6 weeks to 1 week; developing new, highly scaffolded pre-PD work; and modifying the in-person schedule to incorporate more pedagogy and teaching experiences, while continuing to provide in-depth, hands-on support for teachers to learn the basics of programming. The most recent revisions to our PD schedule resulted in improved post-PD survey results, with teachers from the 2018 cohort planning to adopt more of the BJC curriculum than in past years. From 2017 to 2018, planned adoption rates increased by 13%, resulting in 73% of the 2018 PD participants planning to adopt more than 60% of the BJC curriculum and 58% planning to adopt 80-100% of the BJC curriculum in their classrooms in 2018-2019. In this paper, we discuss the most recent BJC PD implementation and provide evidence of increased teacher self-efficacy in areas including fostering interest in computing for underrepresented populations.

This article examines the effects of museums offering texts, cultural artifacts and experiences in English only, which function to exclude patrons, often visiting in family groups, from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This article includes explanations of various theoretical frameworks that help to explain how the construction and dynamism of social boundaries impact museum participation and guide considerations about designing and implementing bilingual and multilingual practices. Examples of successful institutional implementation are included. Recent research findings indicate that positive results for museums and visitors are supported when multilingual practices are central to mission statements and institutional sustainability goals.

AB Three education classes of mostly prospective teachers provided instruction on issues related to Lesbian- and Gay-identified (LG) youth in schools, including readings, a video, a guest speaker, discussion, and writings. Written responses of 97 students, of whom more than a third were students of color, revealed lack of knowledge of LG youth prior to instruction and strong appreciation for new knowledge. Some students voiced resistance and reconciliation related to religiosity, and many-raised questions-regarding classroom application. The dominant stance, however, was appreciation for challenges facing LG youth and reports of plans to advocate for them in schools. Students made many, links to broader social justice issues. Enabling classroom processes appear to have included an equity framework, cultural insider perspectives, and a safe discussion space-design principles for teacher education and development related to advocating for all youth.

TI Practical Tips for Creating a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
   Committee: Experience From a Multicenter, Academic Radiology Department
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIANS; GENDER; RACE
AB Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 and the publicly documented deaths of countless Black individuals have highlighted the need to confront systemic racism, address racial/ethnic disparities, and improve diversity and inclusion in radiology. Several radiology departments have begun to create diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committees to systematically address DEI issues in radiology. However, there are few articles that provide departments with guidance on how to create DEI committees to comprehensively address DEI issues in radiology. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with a framework and practical tips for creating a comprehensive, institutionally aligned radiology DEI committee. Methods: The authors describe key components of the strategic planning process and lessons learned in the creation of a radiology DEI committee, on the basis of the experience of an integrated, academic northeastern radiology department. Results: A hospital-based strategic planning process defining the DEI vision, mission, goals, and strategies was used to inform the formation of the radiology department DEI committee. The radiology department performed gap analyses by conducting internal and external research. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analyses were performed on the basis of consultations with institutional and other departmental DEI leaders as well as DEI leaders from other academic medical centers. This framework served as the basis for the creation of the radiology departmental DEI committee, including a steering committee and four task forces (education, research, patient experience, and workforce development), each charged with addressing specific institutional goals and strategies. Conclusions: This review provides academic radiology departments with a blueprint to create a comprehensive, institutionally aligned radiology DEI committee.

TI Tipping Point: Integrating Social Determinants of Health Concepts in a
   College of Nursing
SO JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: State health rankings, national nursing education reform, and increasing awareness of social injustices propelled a college of nursing to transform its strategic plan, infrastructure, and curriculum. The prevalence of social determinants of health (SDOH) in South Carolina indicates a need for the state's health workforce to understand the impact of SDOH and recognize strategies to address and ameliorate SDOH. With the paradigmatic integration of diversity, equity, and inclusion in nursing education, there is a need for programmatic and curricular integration of SDOH to increase awareness, foster understanding, and transform perspectives among nursing faculty, staff, and students. Method: Institutional changes were made to improve inclusive excellence, and the evolutionary process is described. Results: SDOH-rich resources and experiential learning have been integrated across a college of nursing. Conclusion: This journey is ongoing and essential for preparing nurses to advance patient advocacy, health equity, and social justice for diverse populations.

AB The nature of life in the 21st century suggests that schools must prepare students to be thinkers, problemsolvers, collaborators, wise consumers of information, and confident producers of knowledge. The nature of 21st century student populations suggests that schools will have to become more responsive to the broadening array of cultures, languages, experiences, economics, and interests represented in most contemporary classrooms-and to do so in ways that provide equity of access to robust learning experiences for that broad spectrum of learners. Such classrooms will be heterogeneous in nature, and learner-centered, knowledge-centered, assessment-centered, instruction-centered, and community-centered. Teachers in those classrooms will need to be proficient in "teaching up," or planning learning experiences at a high level of challenge while providing scaffolding to support many learners in succeeding with those experiences and extending the challenge in a meaningful way for advanced learners.

TI Land zoning and local discretion in the Korean planning system
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Korea; land-use planning; zoning; local discretion
AB Zonal planning systems are not noted for their promotion of land-use diversification or variety; rather, the rigidity with which they regulate changes in land-use has been a focus of concern in many countries. Zones frequently cut across areas of diverse social, cultural and economic need; they cause sharp divisions in both physical structure and social equity. In some countries, the creation of "buffer" or "mixed use" zones has been viewed as one possible solution; these can blunt the edges of otherwise sharp spatial divisions and promote diversity. Elsewhere, there have been calls for greater local discretion in the planning process and a shift in power away from the strategic level towards the local state. This paper explores the possibility of introducing such a system in Korea. It considers some of the problems that have stemmed from rigid zoning using the example of recent moves to amend "restricted development zone" boundaries. It then offers two paths for change: the extension of existing powers to give local authorities greater discretion in planning decisions, or the introduction of discretionary planning zones as a standard and widely available regulatory tool.

SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC HISTORY

ID OPTIMALITY; BOWHEAD
AB This article analyzes the connection between investment decisions and financing arrangements in the nineteenth-century American whaling industry. Managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the covariance between their own returns, and those of others, in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. The analysis suggests a link between financial market development, or the extent of risk sharing in financial markets, and the range of economic activities pursued.

TI Ten Strategies to Reduce Gender Inequality at Scientific Conferences

ID DIVERSITY; WOMEN; WORK; SCIENCE; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; MATTERS
AB Conferences organized by professional societies provide scientists and professionals with an excellent opportunity to disseminate their work, network with like-minded researchers, and form collaborative relationships for future endeavors. However, these opportunities are rarely distributed equally between women and men in science. Addressing gender inequity should be a primary consideration for all societies hosting conferences. Yet, many STEM conferences are struggling with gender biases and the understanding that gender inequity also applies to non-binary gender and overlapping social identities. At the Society for Conservation Biology's 4th International Marine Conservation Congress (IMCC4), "Promoting the Participation of Women at Science Conferences" was one of four focus groups of the Diversity Focus Group Series. This paper outlines 10 feasible intervention strategies delineated during the Women at Science Conferences focus group discussion as positive encouragement for professional societies to continue toward gender equity. The 10 interventions to reduce gender inequity at conferences include adopting community principles and a Code of Conduct, appointing a Safety Officer, requiring a registration honor system pledge and conduct surveys, offering a mentorship program, organizing focus groups, giving benefits for participating in diversity programming, assisting with child care, proffering travel grants, providing badges on lanyards, and randomizing the conference program. These strategies are intended to reduce participation barriers for women scientists at conferences, and range in the amount of planning they require to provide options for all societies regardless of their fiscal or labor capacity.

AB The 46th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) approved this past September a document entitled "Proposed PAHO gender equality policy" and urged Member States to implement specific policies accordingly, in collaboration with other government sectors, international organizations, and interested parties from civil society. The approved policy is rooted in principles of gender equality and gender equity, the empowerment of men and women, respect for diversity, and gender mainstreaming. PAHO will integrate and support among its Member States the perspective of gender equality in planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating policies, programs, projects, and research. The aim is, among other things, to attain the highest possible health and well-being for men and women during their whole life cycle, as well as in all population groups. Hopefully these measures will help propel the Region toward the attainment of true gender equality.

AB This article elaborates a conceptual framework to examine social sustainability in marine spatial planning (MSP). Based on a critical literature review of key texts on social sustainability in MSP and the broader sustainable development literature we show the need to elaborate a cogent and comprehensive approach for the analysis and pursuit of social sustainability linked to the sea. We then theorize social sustainability by developing a conceptual framework through integrating three dimensions: Recognition, Representation and Distribution. While these three social sustainability/justice features clearly overlap and are interdependent in practice, the conceptual thinking underpinning each of them is distinctive and when taken together they contribute towards conceiving social sustainability as a pillar of sustainability. Our approach can support an analysis/evaluation of MSP in that, first, its broad scope and adaptability makes it suitable to examine the wide range of claims, demands, and concerns that are likely to be encountered across different practical MSP settings. Second, it acknowledges the opportunities and challenges of assessing, implementing, and achieving social justice within a broader sustainability framework.

ID STEREOTYPES; EXPERIENCES; MEN
AB Orientation: Regardless of the implementation of the Employment Equity Act (EEA), No. 55 of 1998 and the abolishment of apartheid in 1994, African and mixed-race females are under-represented in managerial positions in the public sector of the Western Cape (WC) in South Africa and nationally in the private health sector.
   Research purpose: The purpose was to explore the views of nurses about promotion to managerial positions in view of the Employment Equity Act (EEA) and the possible influence of race, class and gender.
   Motivation for the study: South Africa has a history of racial hierarchies and gender inequities. It was therefore important to explore the influence of the EEA and race, class and gender on the promotion of nurses in the post-apartheid context.
   Research approach/design and method: A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was completed. Six hundred and eighty-eight (n = 688) nurses consented to participate and 573 (83%) questionnaires were returned.
   Mian findings: Race as a social construct surfaced in the superior viewing of white and the inferior viewing of African nurses. Mixed-race and white nurses seemed disgruntled with the EEA because of the benefits it holds for African nurses. African nurses seemed angered by their under-representation in managerial positions in the private and public sectors in the WC. White nurses seemed convinced that African, mixed-race and Indian nurses experience upward mobility. Mixed-race nurses (public sector WC) showed concerns about the career successes of males in a female-dominated profession.
   Practical/managerial implications: Managerial structures should be required to invest in diversity training, create awareness of the noble intentions of the EEA and communicate the relevance of employment equity plans.
   Contribution/value-add: The findings provided evidence that reflected a need for diversity training and the creation of awareness about the longstanding influence of racial and gender hierarchies.

AB The attention to pupil diversity is still considered one of the main issues to solve in the current educational system. The objective of the study was to establish and analyze the differences between the knowledge and the use of ordinary and extraordinary measures in the attention to diversity from the point of view of compulsory secondary education teachers. A descriptive study was performed with a quantitative methodology, making use of a 452-teacher sample (Mean: 47, Standard Deviation: 8.42) using a survey. The results show a better understanding and frequency of use of the ordinary measures compared to the extraordinary ones. Results also maintain that among the most used we found the adequacy of the didactic planning as well as the support of the therapeutic pedagogy and language and auditory specialist. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the CMOEAD (ordinary and extraordinary measures for the attention to diversity) survey possesses psychometric properties which support its use in further studies. In conclusion, a better knowledge and use of ordinary and extraordinary measures in attention to diversity enables a forward leap in the quality and equity for pupils.

AB This article explores the connection between subsidized housing and sustainable urban form. Given the general disconnect between new market-rate housing in sustainable, walkable neighborhoods and affordable housing opportunities, we expect affordable housing to be located in less sustainable locations in terms of proximity to amenities, walkability, street connectivity, density, and diversity of urban form. A rich set of parcel and planning data for the city of Chicago was used to correlate sustainability indicators with the locations of both project- and tenant-based affordable housing programs. Difference-in-means tests and other descriptive statistical analysis suggest that project-based locations (with the exception of Chicago Housing Authority family units) actually score above average, especially in terms of accessibility and walkability, albeit it at the cost of concentrated poverty, racial segregation, and crime. In contrast, vouchers are located in less sustainable locations when it comes to accessibility and walkability, although they are in neighborhoods with more diversity and less poverty - and, at lower voucher concentrations, with less segregation and crime - than project units.

AB Public Significance Statement Child, youth, and family (CYF) health initiatives are often developed within the healthcare system to focus on individual health and wellness from a medical perspective. This study offers insights from community engagement with public, private, and non-profit organizations, illustrating the need for community-based participatory research and population health approaches to enhance systemic integration, collaboration, inclusivity, equity, and empowerment in CYF initiatives.
   Background and Objectives: As hospital-based pediatric clinicians and researchers, we conducted engagement with representatives from public, private, and nonprofit organizations in the Peel Region of Ontario. Objectives were to build relationships and inform research, education, innovation, and programming to improve the health of local children, youth, and families (CYF). Method: Relevant public, private, and nonprofit organizations were identified through an extensive environmental scan. Semistructured interviews and focus groups were conducted with front-line, managerial, and executive representatives. Analysis consisted of thematic analysis and quantitative content analysis. All participants were invited to a 1-day community networking event to discuss the engagement findings and brainstorm next steps. Results: Final sample was n = 155 individuals from n = 61 organizations. The community networking event included n = 45 participants from n = 41 organizations. Participants identified the top three health issues facing families as: (a) mental health and wellbeing (63%); (b) socioeconomic insecurity (52%); (c) lack of physical activity (43%). Major themes included: holistic health and wellness; equity and sociocultural dimensions of health; cross-sector/organizational collaboration and integration; need for inclusive, action-oriented, and participatory approaches. Conclusions: Insights from these engagement activities led to the development of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to CYF health in Peel. In this article we posit CBPR and a population health approach can come together in research and care to prioritize equity, collaboration, and active participation in a community-wide approach to CYF health.

ID MULTIPLE INEQUALITIES; VIOLENCE; GENDER; DISABILITIES; FEMINISM; SHADOWS
AB This paper addresses the possibilities of documentary research for the intersectional analysis of gender equality policies. For this purpose, this work proposed an analysis of the strategic plans of equality, valid in 2019 (or most recent) developed in the Spanish context at state and autonomic level. Two main issues are examined: 1) the recognition of intersectionality and multiple inequalities; 2) attention to groups located in multiple positions of inequality. The results show a very limited incorporation of the intersectional framework in gender equality plans. However, these plans attend (although in a variable way) to different axes of diversity and inequality: mainly, age / life cycle, territory and social exclusion. The documentary analysis has allowed to locate the intersectional issues that are the object of attention in different social fields: mainly, education, violence and social inclusion policies. At the same time, there is an underrepresentation of interests and needs of racialized, migrant, and ethnic minority women in addition to an insensibility regarding affective-sexual diversity. The critical, reflexive, and situated analysis that involves the intersectionality can help increase the effectiveness and equity of gender equality policies through the inclusion of groups and issues located at intersections of multiple inequalities.

AB Background: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) is continually striving to improve the quality of its publications. The ATA Guidelines Policies and Procedures Task Force was active during 2017. It recently recommended convening a formal standing committee to review and update policies and procedures for the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and Statements on an ongoing basis.
   Objective: This statement reviews the history of official ATA publications and discusses the challenges and findings identified by the Task Force. We also wish to present our "work in progress" and propose future directions for the new ATA Guidelines and Statements Committee (ATA GSC).
   Methods: Our Task Force reviewed the publication record of the ATA with respect to CPGs. We also reviewed existing ATA policies for CPGs and other official statements, examined policies of other organizations, solicited input from external experts and organizations, and convened five conference calls and two in-person meetings.
   Results: The ATA has a rich history of developing official publications that have been influential based on download and citation records as well as changes in practice trends. Key future issues to be further addressed by the ATA GSC include the following: (i) striving to improve the methodologic rigor of development of CPGs while balancing considerations of feasibility and timeliness and the role of transparently communicated expert opinion; (ii) formalizing a framework and process for development of new Statements; (iii) increasing stringency and transparency of management of competing interests of individuals being considered for CPG/Statement panel membership; (iv) encouraging consideration of equity and diversity in CPG/Statement development group composition; (v) increasing relevant stakeholder representation (including patient representatives) in development of CPGs/Statements; and (vi) expanding future guideline implementation strategies.
   Conclusions: As shown by the completed literature search, the ATA has a long history of producing CPGs and Statements with global impact on informing clinical management, education, and research in thyroid diseases. The ATA remains committed to a process of continual improvement of its publications and to meeting stakeholder information needs. Based on the work of our Task Force, we have identified many elements that are needed to achieve this goal and areas of challenge for our new committee.

AB Maximizing the current organizational culture and diversity/inclusion practices within CUNY libraries is crucial to retaining highly talented support staff with significant potential for future leadership roles. This research explores equity, diversity, and inclusion within the library profession, with the intention of implementing strategic frameworks to attract, recruit, and retain underrepresented groups within the University. To spotlight areas of upward mobility within CUNY academic libraries, a CUNY-wide Library Workplace Climate survey on the perceptions of diversity, universal inclusion, and career progression was conducted. The scope of the survey study compares the different perspectives of CUNY librarians, full-time library classified paraprofessionals, and part-time classified staff to measure CUNY's commitment to addressing the diversity gap in the library profession. CUNY-wide, 141 library employees participated in a survey study to uncover professional development opportunities in support of career advancement and upward mobility. Nearly 2 in 5 African American/Black library staff-members are paraprofessionals, while 13.5% are faculty. A stark contrast to 3 in 5 or 64% CUNY library faculty, which identified as White/Caucasian. The findings reinforce the need for measures to maximize workplace diversity through support-staff mentoring, guidance, and recruitment. Workplace mentorship and career development-across all levels within CUNY libraries-cultivate skills for a better work environment that can lead to promotion and successful plans for succession. Investing and sustaining structured library professional development opportunities geared toward underrepresented groups-generally in paraprofessional and student-worker roles-will help identify next generation CUNY library leadership.

AB Exclusionary discipline is commonly employed in U. S. schools and disproportionately affects students of color. This article describes current approaches to discipline and contextualizes these approaches historically with particular attention to racial dynamics and violence. We identify the harmful effects of exclusionary discipline and describe efforts to move schools away from exclusionary approaches through school-wide positive behavioral intervention supports, social emotional-learning, and restorative practices. We identify limitations of current discipline reform efforts that are hampering progress toward equitable schooling. We explicate the need for integrative and comprehensive culturally responsive approaches to positive student development that are equity oriented and identify implementation challenges and tools for addressing these challenges. Impact Statement The paper guides practitioners in evaluating whether their own school discipline reform efforts have promise or pitfalls for substantially reducing disparities. Practitioners are urged to consider the degree to which their discipline reform efforts may (a) ignore institutional oppression, (b) profess cultural neutrality, (c) neglect to integrate robust social, emotional, and behavioral supports, and (d) fail to include equitable access to academic rigor and challenge. The paper then offers practitioners directions for developing integrative, equity-oriented, and culturally responsive approaches to change.

   MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB This paper explores the role of socioeconomic metrics in the design, planning and operations of civil engineering projects within the specific context of resilience. The inclusion of resilience analysis and design is consistent with the goals of the ASCE Infrastructure Resilience Division (IRD) and related emerging standards and duties of civil engineers. This paper focuses on the practices in design, planning, construction, and operation of civil engineering projects that can deliver social value to communities and offers a set of socioeconomic metrics for consistently measuring these benefits. Socioeconomic metrics benchmark benefits including safety, social equity, health and well-being, prosperity, cohesion and inclusivity, and mobility and accessibility during the whole life-cycle of a project. A review of metrics is presented and expanded with an emphasis on the need for contextual narrative support to their application. The aim is to establish further the use of metrics in civil engineering projects to set values at the community level and formulate them to justify and rationalize resilience interventions and strategies. The reviewed concepts and categorized project metrics can be used by a range of actors in addition to civil engineers, such as urban planners, policy makers, or regional developers, preferably in a collaborative manner across these groups, particularly to help prioritize the investment of resources and funds to achieve resilience. Three project examples at differing levels of complexity are presented to conceptually illustrate the approaches outlined herein.

AB Women and minority students are largely underrepresented in the physical sciences. Here we describe a faculty-, student-, and staff-led group, called a Departmental Action Team (DAT), created to study the recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented minorities in one physical sciences department. As a result of the DAT' s work, the department has created a new standing committee to improve outreach and support for students from underrepresented groups. We describe how the efforts of the DAT created a departmental context that was able to leverage a campus-level diversity initiative to support meaningful, department-wide discussions and a plan for improving diversity and equity in the major. As such, we present an example of departmental change that could serve as a model for other physical science departments seeking to create similar change.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this research is to deepen the understanding of DEI training and show how scholars across the nation incorporated DEI leadership into academic roles. Faculty and administrators' experiential experience in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) plays a role in the success or failure of DEI training. DEI training at institutes of higher learning should include metrics that examine our bias for invisible and overt support for DEI. Methods: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Nurse Faculty Scholars (RWJFNFS) were surveyed by The Gauda Group at Grayling. Data were collected from a diverse group of scholars across the nation. An online survey followed by an in-depth phone interview was used to assess participants' roles as leaders in academic nursing, challenges faced by scholars in addressing DEI, and perceived values of undertaking DEI activities. Results: Major themes emerged from the findings. The themes included championing for DEI comes with a personal and professional risk. Greater success was noted when DEI was supported by leadership and included in institutional strategic planning. Conclusion: DEI is important and necessitates commitment from all levels of leadership, faculty, and strategic planning initiatives. DEI training fills an important role and subsidizes leadership effectiveness as it relates to DEI.

AB Individuals with disabilities face many physical, cognitive, and/or emotional challenges and must attend to societal factors that often limit participation in activities and interactions with others (King et al., 2003). One method of educating and helping children learn about and become more comfortable interacting with their peers with disabilities is having them participate in disability awareness programs (Magnusson et al., 2017). The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with suggestions and tips to plan a disability awareness program and describe the activities included in an event which celebrated Girl Scouts World Thinking Day.

   Guinea's health policy: a triangulated analysis applying data-mining and
   content analytic techniques
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
LA English

ID LESSONS
AB Background: Gender mainstreaming is an approach to policy and planning that emphasizes equality between the sexes. It is the stated policy for gender equity in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) health sector, as well as all other sectors, and is enshrined in the policies of its biggest aid givers. However, there is criticism that gender mainstreaming's application has too often been technocratic and lacking in conceptual clarity not only in PNG but elsewhere. In the health sector this is further exacerbated by a traditional bio-medical approach, which is often paternalistic and insufficiently patient-and family-centered.
   Methods: This study analyses the policy attitudes toward gender in PNG's health sector using both data-mining and a traditional, summative content analysis.
   Results: Our results show that gender is rarely mentioned. When it is, it is most often mentioned in relation to programs such as maternity and childcare for women, and elsewhere is applied technocratically.
   Conclusion: For PNG to promote greater levels of equity, the focus should first be on conceptualizing gender in a way that is meaningful for Papuans, taking into account the diversity of experiences and setting. Second, there should be greater focus on activists and civil society groups as the stakeholders most likely to make a difference in gender equity.

   transportation
AB Today, 70% of the world's poor are women. Women walk distances that are between 11-16% longer than men, make approximately 15% more journeys than men and only 3% of them commute by bicycle. In Latin America and the Caribbean, women are the main users of public transport. While using it, they are faced with issues such as sexual harassment or lack of infrastructure to fit their needs. In other regions, however, the number of new drivers is rising twice as quickly among women as it is among men, sometimes outnumbering the number of male drivers.
   Costa Rica is a country with important mobility issues. This is taking a toll on its economy, competitiveness and environment. The poor public transport system and the absence of adequate land planning policies has led the city to expand and for an alarmingly increased number of -privileged- Costaricans to use private vehicles as their main means of transportation. As a result, 45% of the country's emissions derive from transport, and pollution levels in the Great Metropolitan Area are currently above WHO limits.
   As a country that takes pride in being a leader in sustainability, this paper proposes including gender perspective in design criteria for mobility solutions as a reminder that without social equity and inclusivity, the country cannot claim to be truly sustainable. Based on interviews and international case study analysis about gender-related mobility needs, it adjusts them to the local context of a developing, tropical country. It includes elements such as safety, vigilance, lighting, seat distribution, the inclusion of women in decision making and in operation of transport facilities and vehicles. These solutions can bring Costa Rica's mobility system closer to sustainability by becoming more inclusive and considerate of women's needs and reducing the need for them to resort to private mobility.

AB Introduction: Although erectile dysfunction (ED) involves an interaction between physiological and psychological pathways, the psychosocial aspects of ED have received considerably less attention so far.
   Aim: To review the available evidence on the psychosocial aspects of ED in order to develop a position statement and clinical practice recommendations on behalf of the European Society of Sexual Medicine (ESSM).
   Method: A comprehensive, narrative review of the literature was performed.
   Main outcome measures: Specific statements and recommendations according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria were provided.
   Results: A multidisciplinary treatment, in which medical treatment is combined with a psychological approach, is preferred over unimodal treatment. There is increasing evidence that psychological treatments of ED can improve medical treatments, the patient's adherence to treatment, and the quality of the sexual relationship. The main components of psychological treatment of ED involve cognitive and behavioral techniques aimed at reducing anxiety, challenging dysfunctional beliefs, increasing sexual stimulation, disrupting sexual avoidance, and increasing intimacy and communication skills in a relational context. When applicable and possible, it is strongly recommended to include the partner in the assessment and treatment of ED and to actively work on interpartner agreement and shared decision-making regarding possible treatment options. To ensure a better integration of the biopsychosocial model into clinical practice, developing concrete treatment protocols and training programs are desirable.
   Conclusion: Because the psychosocial approach to ED has been underexposed so far, this position statement provides valuable information for clinicians treating ED. Psychological interventions on ED are based on existing theoretical models that are grounded in empirical evidence. However, the quality of available studies is low, which calls for further research. The sexual medicine field would benefit from pursuing more diversity, inclusivity, and integration when setting up treatments and evaluating their effect.

AB Laws promoting equal employment opportunity (EEO) in favor of applicants from "protected groups" are commonplace in many countries. The present study compared graduate applicants from protected vs. unprotected groups. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior and on social cognitive theory we explored how intentions to apply for jobs are shaped by behavioral beliefs (internal factors) and protection status (external factor). Results from structural invariance analysis showed that, overall, beliefs influenced applicant intentions similarly in both groups. However, relative weights analysis revealed notable differences in the relative influence of attitude and norm beliefs. The findings suggest that recruitment practitioners and scholars may better understand how applicant intentions are formed if the role of protection status is considered in conjunction with applicant beliefs.

DE Cultural and linguistic diversity; professional development; critical
   multiculturalism; teacher learning
AB This article describes context-based professional development (PD) for cultural diversity in a Portuguese school cluster, and discusses how it supports change for justice and equity. Teachers felt the importance of PD and showed willingness and interest to learn. Several teacher learning opportunities were mapped out such as formal workshops, starting small collaborations and teachers' self-directed informal learning activities. Yet, a rather fragmented character of PD seemed to emerge in terms of content on cultural diversity and forms of learning. Conflicting agendas, scattered teacher collaboration and commitment, and little student and community involvement in planned PD were found. Furthermore, there seemed to be tensions between current PD and teachers' needs and circumstances; teachers wished for more specific information and pedagogical solutions, more collaboration and more organisational support in PD. Applying a critical multicultural perspective, it is discussed that although the current constellation of PD is a potential start, it might still contribute to teachers' conceptual confusion and pedagogical insecurities on the field of cultural diversity. It is suggested that criticality towards PD frames is needed to re-centre cultural diversity on the premises of justice, as well as teacher support, and conscious learning with and from students, families and communities.

AB This study investigated discursive positioning moves that facilitated Latino/a English learners' (ELs) opportunities to take on agentive problem-solving roles in group mathematical discussion. A focus on mechanisms that support students' agentive participation is consistent with our view that recurrent experiences participating and being positioned in particular ways contribute to identity development. Findings suggest several ways that discursive positioning facilitated ELs' agentive participation, including via: (a) explicit statements that validated ELs' reasoning, (b) invitations to share, justify, or clarify thinking that positioned ELs as competent problem solvers, and (c) inviting peers to respond to an EL's idea in ways that positioned the idea as important and/or mathematically justified.

TI Flexible Learning Spaces: Inclusive by Design?
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Innovative Learning Environments; Flexible Learning Space; ILE;
   Inclusion; Equity; School design
AB The idea that the New Zealand education system will cater to all students, regardless of ability, and support them in developing their full potential to the best of their abilities, is enshrined in the famous 1939 Beeby/Fraser statement. Equality of access policy discourse has shifted to emphasise equitable outcomes, focussed increasingly on preparing students for success in the globalised, 21st century knowledge economy. In this context, the design and development of innovative new school buildings and refurbishments of existing facilities have been promoted as a policy that will enable, even bring about, modern pedagogical practices that, in turn, will achieve the stated aim of preparing students for the 21st century global economy. Arguments against retaining traditional single-cell classrooms include their perpetuation of traditional, mainstream (one-size-fits-all') approaches to teaching and learning, while new, radical building designs hold the promise of enabling the desired new' pedagogies. Flexible learning environments encourage and enable teachers to exchange front-of-the-room', single teacher presentational approaches for collaborative, dispersed and facilitative styles, often in teams, working with multiple students in shared, common learning spaces. The New Zealand Curriculum has ensured inclusion as an educational principle, and current Ministry of Education policy discourse reminds schools of their commitment to this principle, and specifically links building design and design processes to ensuring inclusivity. So it should be asked whether non-traditional, flexible learning spaces can be inclusive. This article places this question in the context of the historically evolving approach to inclusion in the New Zealand context, and with reference to the spatial turn' in recent New Zealand education policy. This turn to enhanced flexibility and innovation has implications for inclusivity, reflected in both Ministry of Education policy discourse and critiques suggesting the exclusionary effects of flexibility. It is argued with reference to Lefebvre that notions of inclusion and exclusion are inherent in social practices that are both superimposed upon material space as much as they are influenced by the design features of that space.

AB The Public Administration in its broadest connotations encompasses to serve the people through effective planning and execution of public policies. The core guiding pillars of governmental administration are participation, democratic decision making, transparency, equity and fairness in public policies while rolling out governmental schemes and programs. The very reason for the administration being in existence is for catering the needs of larger populace. The Political decision makers are supposed to remain objective while deciding the policies and programmes; however the objectivity or policy neutrality remains elusive in real observation. The selective treatment of electorate in different constituencies reflects the loss of objectivity and negation of transparency, justice, equity and fairness in the service delivery of governmental programmes. The public services should be provided in the most democratic manner to the masses and every effort is required to make sure that the services do not become elitist or privileged class centric. The bureaucracy very often finds itself in a situation where the political influence mandates to have subjective decision making. The public policies are in general umbrella policies which are comprehensive in scope and include various stake holders therefore the policy inclusivity should be a virtue for all public policies. The powerful, the elitist continue to enjoy the best of the public services be it health, education, and security and the marginalized, the weaker remains at the receiving end when it comes to accessing the quality governmental services. The general neglect of the interests of common classes in the conduct of politic-administrative systems further deteriorates the quality of services being delivered to them. The lack of accountability, proper monitoring and effective controls in the planning and execution of public programmes impacts adversely upon quality of service delivery. The role of technology is vital in regard to ensure that the subjective biases, information containment, ethical compromises, moral turpitude, inequality and unfair practices are curbed up to a great extent. One of the foremost virtues of technology is that it does promote the free flow of information through all the channels and it is neutral. However some reasonable doubts are being raised over the utility and significance of technology in promoting participation, transparency, equity, fairness and justice in the delivery of governmental services to the people specially the poor and impoverished. Therefore caution and due diligence is required while advocating for the larger role of technology (E-Governance) in streamlining the service delivery processes. The symmetry between technology and politico-administrative system calls for overhauling the entire system of public service delivery with the intent of identifying the critical problem areas and finding the plausible solutions.

TI Addressing Intersectional Identities and Experiences in Professional
   Psychology Trainees With Disabilities: A Call for Action
SO TRAINING AND EDUCATION IN PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE disability; intersectionality; psychologists with disabilities; trainees
ID DIVERSITY; LEGAL
AB Diversity, equity, and inclusion are frequently espoused as critical priority areas in psychology, including education and training. Professional psychology trainees and psychologists with disabilities experience a unique set of barriers (e.g., inaccessible work environments, lack of relevant mentorship experiences, and cultural competency surrounding disability) that contribute to negative consequences for training, recruitment, and retention. Furthermore, disabled trainees and psychologists with intersecting and marginalized identities possess a nuanced perspective on these challenges that are largely missing from both the data and scholarly literature in the field. To address this disparity, it is imperative that the field of professional psychology takes action to collect more nuanced population-level data but also actively implement change strategies to advance the field. Strategies for identifying unique barriers and perspectives of disabled trainees with intersecting identities include conducting subanalyses of larger data sets that are appropriate for smaller sample sizes, conducting contextual (e.g., qualitative) research centering the voices of multiple marginalized and disabled trainees, creating and reinforcing an antiableist culture at training programs and work environments, amplifying the voices and expertise of trainees and psychologists with disabilities and intersecting identities, and supporting disabled trainees and psychologists who may experience activism fatigue. Such actions are critical for bolstering the representation of disabled trainees and psychologists with intersecting identifies, and ultimately improving our delivery of services to patients who experience similar challenges, barriers, and discrimination in their own lives.
   Public Significance Statement Diversity, equity, and inclusion are viewed as important in psychology, and disability is increasingly being recognized as part of that diversity. Despite this, very little data or other literature exists on the experiences of psychology trainees who also have other marginalized identities. The contributions of disabled psychologists with multiple marginalized identities are important to the growth and improvement of psychological science and practice, and the experiences and needs of these trainees must be understood and valued.

AB Aim: To improve undergraduate nursing students and educator intercultural knowledge and competencies by implementing an academic systems change.
   Background: Many organizations have diversity and inclusion guidelines and initiatives for healthcare providers to consider in determining culturally competent care, which has a direct impact on the care given, received, and overall outcomes.
   Design: 1. Assess student's mindset at the beginning and the end of an undergraduate nursing course. 2. Ensure diversity and inclusion content was provided to faculty through a continuing education program. 3. Review all undergraduate courses for diversity and inclusion content.
   Methods: The Intercultural Development Inventory (R), a 50-item cross-cultural, theory-based assessment tool was used in a pre- and post-test design (n = 61 intervention; n = 56 control) to determine undergraduate nursing student's mindset and assists the student's in developing a personalized Intercultural Development Plan. The effectiveness of faculty diversity and inclusion education was evaluated using a post program evaluation. Curricular blueprinting of all undergraduate nursing courses for diversity and inclusion content was completed.
   Results: The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the post-test between the intervention and control groups.
   Conclusion: While evidence is lacking in specificity of how to best implement diversity and inclusion content in curriculum, these results provided some excellent baseline data that can be tracked while continued changes occur.

AB Population ageing signals the need for a responsive community aged care workforce respectful of older people's diverse healthcare needs. Person-centered care premises individual needs and preferences to enhance participation in health care. Training for diversity does not yet exist for this workforce, but is necessary to ensure appropriate care for diverse community-dwelling older people. This article aims to review the range of research traditions for conceptualizing diversity training, theoretical approaches, and empirical findings to understand the relevance for the community aged care sector. Using a meta-narrative approach, research from health, education, psychology, sociology, and business literature was reviewed for meaningful contribution to supporting training for community aged care workers. Meta-narrative review principles included: planning, searching, mapping, appraisal/synthesis, and recommendations. Six meta-narratives were identified, consolidated into three areas: person-centered and culturally competent health care; human rights approach; and psychological approaches to diversity training. The meta-narratives highlighted diversity within diversity and a move toward intersectionality. Meta-narratives were linked through concepts of inclusion, reduction in bias, and access and equity healthcare policy and practice. Training for community aged care workers is challenging, with this synthesis providing new understandings of diversity training, paramount for provision of responsive and equitable health care for older people.

ID DIVERSITY; SCIENCES
AB Gender balance refers to the equitable treatment and access to opportunities for all genders. In order to achieve true gender balance, a variety of proactive approaches developed collaboratively, with insight from multiple perspectives, need to be implemented. With that purpose, the participation of women in professions related to radiation and radiation protection was prioritised and given high visibility by allocating a 'Women in Radiation' (WiR) Special Session at the 15th International Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA), hosted by South Korea on 20 January 2021. In this session, various issues related to gender balance and equity/equality were highlighted by the panellists, and further elaborated in a subsequent discussion with attendees. The main goal of the WiR Special Session was to convene women from different organisations, career and age stages, disciplines and countries, in particular to consider the Asian-Oceanic vision and status of gender equality, along with other topics to support a 'Call for Action', with concrete recommendations subsequently provided to IRPA. The discussion stressed the main needs and challenges faced by women working in various radiation fields, along with raising awareness of possible professional and employment opportunities. This paper identifies some steps necessary to encourage, enhance and support the inclusion of more diversity in nuclear professions with specific emphasis on women. In conclusion, gender balance and equality must be at the heart of any strategic plan for the future of the radiological protection profession; international cooperation between relevant bodies is essential for success and could serve as a catalyst for specific policy statements aimed at achieving a balanced representation of women in radiological protection.

It reviews literature on current approaches to reading instruction for linguistically and culturally diverse and low socioeconomic students, noting the current policy emphasis on the teaching of comprehension as autonomous skills and strategies. The Four Resources model (Freebody and Luke 1990) is used to frame comprehension instruction with an emphasis on student cultural and community knowledge, and substantive intellectual and sociocultural content in elementary and middle school curricula. Illustrations are drawn from research underway on the teaching of literacy in low socioeconomic schools.

AB Covid-19 changed the way many people viewed and interacted with the natural environment. In the UK, a series of national lockdowns limited the number of places that individuals could use to support their mental and physical health. Parks, gardens, canals and other "green infrastructure" (GI) resources remained open and were repositioned as "essential infrastructure" supporting well-being. However, the quality, functionality and location of GI in urban areas illustrated a disparity in distribution that meant that in many cases communities with higher ethnic diversity, lower income and greater health inequality suffered from insufficient access. This paper provides commentary on these issues, reflecting on how planners, urban designers and environmental organizations are positioning GI in decision-making to address inequality. Through a discussion of access and quality in an era of austerity funding, this paper proposes potential pathways to equitable environmental planning that address historical and contemporary disenfranchisement with the natural environment in urban areas.

AB The field of special education continues to grapple with the presence and implications of disproportional representation related to race and ethnicity. While research focuses mostly on disproportional representation of students, there remains long-standing acknowledgment that too few students of color populate our special education university doctoral programs. The present study, therefore, surveyed current special education faculty members at doctoral degree granting institutions to understand the practices used to recruit and retain doctoral students of color and perspectives on their programs' climate related to racial and ethnic diversity. In addition, the research team conducted a series of exploratory analyses to examine whether responses depended on respondent race or whether the respondent worked at a minority-serving institution. Results suggest a general commitment to increasing doctoral student diversity; however, there appears a lack of formalized plans and culturally relevant coursework. Findings of the exploratory analyses suggest that programs within minority-serving institutions may provide important leadership in this area. We conclude with limitations and recommendations for doctoral programs.

AB In this dialogue with Phillip A. Boda's Conceptualizing the margins into science education praxis: disability as case in point, I would like to continue the conversation on an equity-focused graduate course meant to prepare pre-service educators to value and leverage diversity in the classroom. While Boda's analysis revealed that graduate students struggled to attend to disability as a marker of diversity when planning classroom activities, a similar study conducted by Waitoller and Kozleski (Teach Teach Educ Int J Res Stud 31:35-45, 2013. 10.1016/j.tate.2012.11.006) showed that graduate students often attended to disability over cultural diversity. Both studies point to the need for teacher preparation programs that prepare educators to create inclusive environments that support, value, and empower students at the intersection of various forms of diversity. This article will leverage axiological shifts noted in graduate students' reflections from Boda's study to start a discussion about Waitoller and Kozleski's view of inclusive education. Pulling from scholarship on asset-based pedagogies and my experience as an urban science educatorin special education settings, I will discuss opportunities to create educator learning experiences that can connect theory and practice.

ID OVER-EDUCATION; BLACK-WOMEN; PAY GAP; DIVERSITY; RACE
AB This article uses case study interviews to examine women's experiences in higher education. It focuses on career progression, support available for promotion and particular initiatives for staff retention. The findings suggest that whilst some progress has been made to support White and Black and minority ethnic women in their career trajectories, greater change is needed in order that inclusion is embedded within institutional frameworks and strategic plans. Furthermore, clearer evidence is needed by universities to demonstrate how they are meeting their legal equality requirements as specified by the Equality Act (2010). The mere presence of diversity and equality policies does not necessarily demonstrate that gender and ethnic inequalities are being addressed. Such policies may simply result in a 'tick box' exercise. In order to address such inequalities, issues of diversity and equality must be embedded within the cultural organisation of institutions which are identified in key objectives resulting in real outcomes and practice. Additionally, there is a need to consider intersectional identities and the impact of ethnicity on women's experiences in higher education.

AB To ensure future sustainability, cities need to consider concepts of livability and resident wellbeing alongside environmental, economic and infrastructure development equity. The current rapid urbanization experienced in many regions is leading to sustainability challenges, but also offers the opportunity to deliver infrastructure supporting the social aspects of cities and the services that underpin them alongside economic growth. Unfortunately, evidence of what is needed to deliver urban wellbeing is largely absent from the global south. This paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap through a novel interdisciplinary mixed methods study undertaken in two rapidly changing cities (one Thai and one Kenyan) using qualitative surveys, subjective wellbeing and stress measurements, and spatial analysis of urban infrastructure distribution. We find the absence of basic infrastructure (including waste removal, water availability and quality) unsurprisingly causes significant stress for city residents. However, once these services are in place, smaller variations (inequalities) in social (crime, tenure) and environmental (noise, air quality) conditions begin to play a greater role in determining differences in subjective wellbeing across a city. Our results indicate that spending time in urban greenspaces can mitigate the stressful impacts of city living even for residents of informal neighborhoods. Our data also highlights the importance of places that enable social interactions supporting wellbeing-whether green or built. These results demonstrate the need for diversity and equity in the provision of public realm spaces to ensure social and spatial justice. These findings strengthen the need to promote long term livability in LMIC urban planning alongside economic growth, environmental sustainability, and resilience.

AB This study engaged a critical discourse analysis to examine statements from higher education leaders regarding the rescission of the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The research questions addressed were as follows. (a) What discourses are present in higher education leaders' responses to the DACA rescission and DACA students? (b) What discourses are present regarding the role of U.S. higher education in the immigration policy agenda? (c) How do these responses connect to or conflict with broader higher education discourses on diversity, equity, and inclusion? Findings across the 139 institutional responses emphasize the tone of the responses, the depiction of students impacted by the DACA rescission, the forms of institutional commitment discussed in the responses, and the connections that leaders make to institutional identity.

AB Rambo, Adele, and a religion professor walk into a coffee shop. What in the world do they have in common? This essay integrates Lewis Rambo's scholarship on conversion with pop singer Adele's popular song "Send My Love to Your Lover" to understand and redress inequity in individual risk within processes of institutional conversion. The author focuses on practices of inclusion in institutions of higher education using the specific example of theological schools with aspirational school mission statements that embrace equity and diversities. She argues that bringing Rambo and Adele into conversation with anecdotal and published research on institutional (in)justice illuminates four practices that institutions could adopt to better align practice with promise and thereby promote wellness for all who are impacted by institutional health.

AB Purpose of Review The exponential growth of women participating in competitive sports throughout the years was made possible through several initiatives by the International Olympic Committee and the passage and implementation of Title IX as a federal law in the United States. However, this positive trend towards gender equity in sports has not transpired for women in medicine, especially in fields that care for elite athletes. This current review will discuss specific areas that can be tailored to help female athletes prevent injuries and optimize their athletic performance. We will also highlight how increased female team physician representation in sports may help optimize care for female athletes. Recent Findings Female athletes are considered high risk for certain conditions such as ACL tears, patellofemoral pain syndrome, bone stress injuries, sport-related concussions, and sexual violence in sport. Addressing factors specific to female athletes has been found to be valuable in preventing injuries. Strength and conditioning can optimize athletic performance but remains underutilized among female athletes. Although diversity in healthcare workforce has been found to be beneficial for multiple reasons, women remain underrepresented in sports medicine. Increasing female team physician representation may positively impact care for female athletes. Team physicians must understand the physiologic, biomechanical, and anatomic factors that are unique to female athletes in order to tailor injury prevention programs and optimize their athletic performance. Advocating for gender equity in sports medicine to advance representation of women in the field will increase workforce diversity and promote excellence in sports medicine care.

AB Documentation, assessment and evaluation processes in early learning contexts should include participation and contribution from all educators. This helps to ensure diversity of knowledge, perspective and background that can create more inclusive and equitable early learning curricula. This article presents findings from a collective case-study undertaken with educators and pre-school aged children at three early learning services. The educators took part in practitioner inquiry projects focusing on technology integration in play-based learning. The study found a significant inequity in educator contribution to documentation, assessment and evaluation throughout the practitioner inquiry projects. Access to professional learning content, self-reported confidence and lack of allocated time were identified as key factors that impacted educator contribution to documentation and assessment, particularly in reflective journaling. A hierarchy of contribution was also evident in group meetings. Practitioner inquiry was identified as an effective way to promote more equitable contribution and democratic dialogue. The importance of creating a culture of equity of contribution was also identified.

Conventional responses, such as eco-efficiency, focus on doing more with less, restricting industry, and curtailing growth. We view the conflict between industry and the environment as a design problem. Instead of simply reducing industry's negative effects, we suggest companies redesign products and processes for healthy, long-term prosperity. We present a new paradigm for industry, eco-effectiveness; three new design principles: waste equals food, use current solar income, and respect diversity; new decision criteria that integrate ecology, economy, and equity; and beginning steps businesses can take towards a world of abundance, rather than one of limits and constraints.

This research, derived from documentary readings, reviews and theorizations of feminist and post-critical epistemologies, have gender and sexuality views as instruments of power and help understanding social contradictions. The article analyzes the political battles of deconstruction of the agendas destined to the promotion of equality and equity, among them, the interferences in the National Plan of Human Rights, the suspension to Brazil Without Homophobia, the stagnation of the Education Plan; questions the religious fundamentalist rise and the upsurge of conservative and neoliberal sectors that is regarding the reiteration of skewed, prejudiced and violent discourses that can affect and normalize education for sexualities.

AB This article examines 3 models for developing and analyzing culturally responsive teaching in mathematics teacher education. The models were developed from and arc illustrated by findings from a series of exploratory research studies conducted to evaluate various methods for preparing preservice teachers to address the educational implications of bicultural partnership between indigenous Maori and New Zealand European groups. The studies explored the perceptions of preservice and beginning teachers regarding the incorporation of cultural approaches in the teaching of mathematics. The implications of our research regarding the challenges of representing cultural perspectives in mathematics education are discussed in the context of the broader literature on culturally responsive education.

AB As park agencies become increasingly challenged to ensure not just visitation but also support for parks by a diversity of constituents, heterogeneous community engagement has come into greater focus as a research priority for the parks tourism field (Eagles, 2014). To date, however, most studies of immigrants' participation in outdoor recreation have researched "recreational patterns, motivations and constraints" (Kloek, Buijs, Boersema, & Schouten, 2015, p. 48). This article adopts a process approach to map and analyze Parks Canada's community engagement during its work to establish Canada's first national urban park, whereby residents and stakeholders of a highly diverse community were given a platform to express their opinions. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews reveals six themes capturing park planners' assumptions and actions to enhance community outreach and provides rich descriptions of stakeholder-agency relationships using stakeholder theory. Results suggest that to effect change, planning must shift from an equality-based process to an equity-based one.

AB The goal of our paper is to provide our perspectives on why there is a need to change the narrative in academic surgery to improve health equity by increasing the pipeline of pre-med students to professors. It is well documented that Health disparities hurt many different people, but they especially hurt Black, Indigenous, and People of color. Black men and women have a decreased life expectancy. Differences in care are associated with greater mortality among minority patients and that care provided to black patients by black physicians can lead to improved compliance with medications and care plans. The lack of black diversity in the medical profession proportional to the societal ethnic distribution is alarming. We have opportunities for improvement for recruitment, retention and promotion within the field of surgery.

DE nursing; antiblack racism; historical trauma; ally; accomplice;

AB In order to promote health equity and support the human rights mandate contained in the American Nurses Association's Code of Ethics for Nurses with Interpretive Statements, the nursing profession must understand historically the creation of race, white supremacy in the United States, and entrenched racial terror and brutality toward black and brown racialized populations. Considering the limited racial diversity in the nursing profession despite its stated mission to increase diversity, the profession must build a path to understanding antiblack racism as a historical trauma that remains to this day, a path that encompasses antiracist ideology. Antiracism education is critically needed at the pre-professional and professional levels, for nursing students, providers, educators, administrators, and researchers to inform our own understanding of bias within the contexts of our educational and health-care systems. Dismantling racism requires an enduring commitment to the ultimate goal of social justice for ourselves, our patients, and our communities. This article presents antiracism actions that nurses should employ to dismantle racism, focusing primarily on personal-level initiatives, with self-work as the starting point.

DE Sustainability; Sustainable Urban Development; Urban Planning
ID PREFERENCES
AB Since sustainability is an optimization between physical (both natural and man-made), economic and social dimensions of development and conservation, plans, policies and applications in rapidly growing metropolises play a pivotal rote for manifestation of this challenge. This article consists of three inter-related parts. First, core issues of a sustainable master plan are identified from a wide range of readings of the current literature. Second, as one of the most populated and rapidly growing metropolises of the world, Istanbul's master plans between 1980 and 2009 are evaluated in terms of their convenience to the core issues of sustainability. Finally in context of sustainability, the actual position of Istanbul is criticized on the basis of some additional qualitative and quantitative data. The above-mentioned core issues are: urban compactness, sustainable transportation, conservation of historical heritage, a clear balance between nature and man-made environments / permeability of the built environment (for natural corridors), protection of vulnerable natural assets, rehabilitation of natural ecosystems, natural resource management, a place-based economy, control of the population pressure over the environment, (low-income) housing, provision of social equity and cultural diversity. Consideration of these issues aids in analyzing the main policies of the three master plans (1980, 1995 and 2009) in context of sustainability on the one hand and picturing today's Istanbul, on the other. In fact the gap between planning and the actual situation is a characteristic problem for developing countries where illegal developments are almost legitimate. In these countries, planning also suffers from guiding development in sustainable terms due to lack of institutional capacity, participation and inadequate legal arrangements. In brief, this article focuses on the reasons and consequences of such a gap in the case of a rapidly growing metropolis.

TI Gender Equity at Surgical Conferences: Quantity and Quality
SO JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Gender; Disparities; Manels; Surgery; Representation; Opportunity
AB Background: Participation of women at national surgery conferences is an important aspect of achieving gender equity; however, participation has to be meaningful and representative of scientific and clinical achievement. We hypothesized that the presence of women on planning committees would increase the number of women speakers and the presence of women as moderators would increase the number of women panelists. Furthermore, we hypothesized that although women may be included as speakers, they are less likely to speak on clinical and technical surgical topics than men.
   Methods: Four 2018 national surgery conferences were chosen for investigation: Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma, Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, Academic Surgical Conference, and the American Society of Breast Surgeons because of varied subject matter. The published online conference programs were reviewed and participant gender, presentation role, type, and topic were recorded. Sub mitted abstract and scientific articles were excluded from analysis; moderators of these sessions were included. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-squared tests and t tests where appropriate.
   Results: The overall mean percentage of female speakers was 28%. The percentage of women on the program committees positively correlated with the number of women speaking at the conference (Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma, 15.4% women on committee vs 18.92% speakers; Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, 27% versus 22%; Academic Surgical Conference, 38.5% versus 32%; and the American Society of Breast Surgeons, 50% versus 58.55 %; P < 0.001). Panels with greater than 50% female moderators were more likely to have female panelists than those with less than 50% female moderators (23.6% versus 14.8%; P < 0.001). Women were most likely to present awards, introductions, and keynote speeches, then most likely to speak on professionalism (54.84% and 36.29%; P < 0.001). They were significantly less likely to present on a clinical topic, technical skill, or moderate a scientific presentation (25.68% and 26.75%; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Despite increasing attention on improving diversity at surgical conferences, disparities continue to persist. As demonstrated in nonsurgical literature, planning committee gender diversity positively correlated with speaker diversity, and moderator diversity positively correlated with panel diversity. Women were more likely to speak on topics considered "soft sciences", such as professionalism and advocacy, and less likely to present on clinical topics, technical skill, or scientific research.

AB Public bicycle and car sharing schemes have proliferated in recent years and are increasingly part of the urban transport landscape. Shared transport options have the potential to support social inclusion by improving accessibility: these initiatives could remove some of the barriers to car ownership or bicycle usage such as upfront costs, maintenance and storage. However, the existing evidence base indicates that, in reality, users are most likely to be white, male and middle class. This paper argues that there is a need to consider the social inclusivity of sharing schemes and to develop appropriate evaluation frameworks accordingly. We therefore open by considering ways in which shared transport schemes might be inclusive or not, using a framework developed from accessibility planning. In the second part of the paper, we use the case study of Glasgow in Scotland to undertake a spatial equity analysis of such schemes. We examine how well they serve different population groups across the city, using the locations of bicycle stations and car club parking spaces in Glasgow, comparing and contrasting bike and car. An apparent failure to deliver benefits across the demographic spectrum raises important questions about the socially inclusive nature of public investment in similar schemes.

AB We analyze the relationship of board structure features with non-financial firm's performance among West African listed companies. The data was collected though content analysis of annual reports and audited financial statement of 109 West African listed companies over 2002-2017 by utilized three financial performance proxies, namely return on assets, return on equity, and Tobin Q. We employed several model specification tests and regression methods including pooled OLS, fixed effects and GMM two stage models. The results indicate statistically positive relationship between board size and firm performance but only significant with Tobin's Q and positive significant effect of women directorship and women chief executive officer on firm performance. Independent director has statistically positive significant effect on firm financial performance. Paradoxically, women independent directors has negative significant impact on financial performance. Findings imply that corporations should have a board structure including women executives' directors, woman CEO and men independent directors as a way to enhance firm's performance. This paper contributes to developing countries scant literature on determinants financial performance and corporate governance practices by provides evidence on why and how corporation should have independent directors and gender diversity inclusive board structure to enhance firm's performance ones in developing countries.

AB The National Science Foundation and others conclude that institutional transformation is required to ensure equal opportunities for the participation and advancement of men and women in academic science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). Such transformation requires changing the habitual attitudes and behaviors of faculty. Approaching implicit bias as a remediable habit, we present the theoretical basis and conceptual model underpinning an educational intervention to promote bias literacy among university faculty as a step toward institutional transformation regarding gender equity. We describe the development and implementation of a Bias Literacy Workshop in detail so others can replicate or adapt it to their setting. Of the 220 (167 faculty and 53 nonfaculty) attendees from the initial 17 departments/divisions offered this workshop, all 180 who completed a written evaluation found the workshop at least "somewhat useful" and 74% found it "very useful." Over 68% indicated increased knowledge of the workshop material. Of the 186 participants who wrote a commitment to engage in new activities to promote gender equity, 87% incorporated specific workshop content. Twenty-four participants were interviewed 4-6 months after attending the workshop; 75% of these not only demonstrated increased bias awareness, but described plans to change-or had actually changed-behaviors because of the workshop. Based on our sample of faculty from a Midwestern university, we conclude that at least one third of STEMM faculty who are invited will attend a 2.5-hr Bias Literacy Workshop, that nearly all will find it useful, and that most will complete a written commitment to promoting gender equity. These findings suggest that this educational intervention May effectively promote institutional change regarding gender equity.

SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE

DT Article
AB The University of California's (UC's) medical education programs are on the brink of change. In January 2007, the UC system completed a multiyear health sciences planning effort that is the most comprehensive undertaken in decades. For medical student education, the plan calls for an approximately one-third increase in enrollment across the system-from approximately 650 current medical school graduates per year to a projected 920 graduates annually by the year 2020, During the same period, California's population is expected to increase in size and diversity in ways unmatched by any other state in the nation.
   The plan calls for development of new programs that will increase enrollment in unique and unprecedented ways. The first phase of this growth is under way and is planned to continue through a series of programs that seek to address the needs of California's medically underserved communities. Areas of focus include rural health and telemedicine (Davis); the Spanish-speaking Latino community (Irvine), diverse, disadvantaged communities (Los Angeles),- health disparities and health equity (San Diego); and the urban underserved (San Francisco and Berkeley). In November 2006, UC medical schools received $200 million in bond funding to support this growth and to create new telemedicine programs to increase access to services provided by faculty physicians. In the coming years, UC medical schools will face demographic and budgetary challenges that will require perseverance, creativity, and certain leaps of faith. Public expectations are high.

AB While much has been written about preparing educational leaders to lead for social justice, much less has been written about how to do so. This study is one of the first to analyze the reflections and written assignments of aspiring administrators to determine what they are currently thinking about poverty, race/ ethnicity, and social justice leadership and how that thinking is shaped throughout one course. Results indicate that students were variable in their individual reflections, but that assignments, which required them to analyze the inequities in their schools and develop an implementation plan, led all of these aspiring administrators to seek to redress those inequities. The article discusses implications for other programs, which prepare educational leaders.

ID ENERGY JUSTICE; INJUSTICES
AB Energy access rates improved significantly in developing nations in the past decade. However, sub-Saharan Africa still remains with the highest percentage of its population in energy poverty. The diversity of technologies and business models available today offer promise to expanding access for the region. Nonetheless, past energy related inequities point to the key role institutional norms and planning standards play in shaping the consequences of electrification efforts beyond the technologies or the business models employed. For the sub-Saharan Africa region, where country budgets are limited, multilateral organizations and their financial resources remain the critical institutions that set the standards that guide the region's electrification efforts. Through a socio-legal research methodology, the paper applies the energy justice concept as an analytical lens to assess the existing standards and frameworks in the region's energy access planning and decision-making processes. Using energy sector project finance appraisal documents as case studies, we reveal the equity limitations and gaps in the status quo process. The study finds that, although the presence of development finance institutions plays a role in advancing energy access for all, the standards that guide their actions can perpetuate planning processes that generate inequitable outcomes on people and their capabilities. The study provides guiding principles for a just and informed standard for energy access planning.

DE Smart cities; urban planning; community-engaged operations research;

ID VALUE-FOCUSED THINKING; FUTURE
AB While inquiry in operations research (OR) modeling of urban planning processes is long-standing, on the whole, the OR discipline has not influenced urban planning practice, teaching and scholarship at a level of other domains such as public policy and information technology. Urban planning presents contemporary challenges that are complex, multi-stakeholder, data-intensive, and ill structured. Could an OR approach which focuses on the complex, emergent nature of cities, the institutional environment in which urban planning strategies are designed and implemented and which puts citizen engagement and a critical approach at the center enable urban planning to better meet these challenges? Based on a review of research and practice in OR and urban planning, we argue that a prospective and prescriptive approach to planning that is inductive in nature and embraces "methodological pluralism" and mixed methods can enable researchers and practitioners develop effective interventions that are equitable and which reflect the concerns of community members and community serving organizations. We discuss recent work in transportation, housing, and community development that illustrates the benefits of embracing an enhanced OR modeling approach both in the framing of the model and in its implementation, while bringing to the fore three cautionary themes. First, a mechanistic application of decision modeling principles rooted in stylized representations of institutions and systems using mathematics and computational methods may not adequately capture the central role that human actors play in developing neighborhoods and communities. Second, as innovations such as the mass adoption of automobiles decades ago led to auto-centric city design show, technological innovations can have unanticipated negative social impacts. Third, the current COVID pandemic shows that approaches based on science and technology alone are inadequate to improving community lives. Therefore, we emphasize the important role of critical approaches, community engagement and diversity, equity, and inclusion in planning approaches that incorporate decision modeling.

DE values; advocacy; equity; sustainability; diversity
AB In 2004, Robert Stake published a provocative article that asked: "How Far Dare an Evaluator Go Toward Saving the World?" This question raises the issue of what role evaluators' values play in the conduct of evaluations. Following review of Stake's premises, I present value statements from a diverse group of 40 evaluators working with philanthropic foundations. The results update and revise Stake's list of "six advocacies common in evaluation." The findings capture changes in evaluation language and substantive concerns over the last 15 years regarding evaluators' values and engagement. The conclusion affirms Stake's original overarching principle. In closing, I offer an additional concern toward saving the world not on Stake's list or that of the evaluators sampled: global sustainability and environmental justice in the face of the global pandemic and climate emergency. This process of inquiry generated a facilitation tool for use by evaluators, presented here, to support reflective practice about evaluators' values.

AB The goal of this reflection is to lay out that any concept of literacy plays a strategic role inside any culture as it is responsible of strengthening or reducing the social effects produced by some discourses, as well as the material resources that support them. This article expects to analyze some elements that allow to make problematic the contemporary approaches about reading and writing in education, from a decolonial view. From this perspective, in Western society exists a monopoly over the knowledge about literacy, this situation would let the diversity of possibilities of reading and writing at a disadvantage in a dialogue of knowledges. The multimodal discourse theory and the reflections of pedagogy of multiliteracies blow up the writing centered in the graph-alphabetic language to make space for other meaning possibilities. Considering the requests of equity in our societies, it would be inappropriate to refer to literacy as a universally accepted concept.

AB An entrepreneur's mission statement is to create a sustainable competitive advantage in the market by exploiting pecuniary dynamics prevailing in the entrepreneurial expanse. We delve into an integrative analysis of how absolution and relativity of product quality relate to the competition that an entrepreneur grapples with. Owing to the bearing of enterprise financing on both quality and competition, the toggling of optimality levels of financing are portrayed and understood in terms of cost returns of quality. A basic though lethal assumption that is often contracted is the homogeneity of business information between a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur, which is never the case. We analyze mathematically the concept of information entropy that establishes the financial orientations in an entrepreneurial ecosystem. How can an entrepreneur, faced with the challenge of fostering capital structures and other pecuniary instruments in various forms (for e.g. dividends and equity), mediate on the optimality of capital? How is the entrepreneur affected by the seemingly varying impressions of optimal quality and competition amidst a fuzzy information collation shared by him and the venture capitalist? This paper provides an insight into the contours of advantage that an entrepreneur can exploit.

TI Managing Diversity To Eliminate Disparities: A Framework For Health
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB By 2044 there will be no single racial or ethnic majority group in the US, according to the Census Bureau. California experienced this shift in 2000, making the state a bellwether in its attempts to bring health equity to a highly diverse population. We used data from the California Health Interview Survey and the California Regional Health Care Cost and Quality Atlas to examine health, health care access, and quality of care by race/ethnicity, payer, and region. Evaluating insurance coverage and diabetes as a sentinel condition, we found that wealthy regions exhibited the widest disparities-with advantages among non-Latino whites and people with commercial coverage. Disparities were narrowest in rural and agricultural regions, but health and quality of care were lower overall in those regions. State initiatives to address health equity include requiring health plans to reduce disparities by language and race/ethnicity and investing carbon cap-and-trade revenues in disadvantaged communities. Prominent advocacy, community engagement, the systematic use of data, local flexibility, and mechanisms for stronger accountability are driving these initiatives. Evidence has yet to emerge on how effective these policies will be in reducing health disparities in the state.

DE LGBTQ; historic preservation; intersectionality; diversity; cultural

AB In recent years, preservation agencies at the federal, state, and locals levels have advanced more inclusive approaches to historic preservation by commissioning theme studies, surveys, and nominations to registers of historic places that address previously neglected aspects of US heritage. Much of the work done under the broad umbrella of inclusive histories has been focused on communities defined by a single aspect of identity. This essay raises questions about the effectiveness of single-community studies in addressing previously overlooked aspects of history at the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and more. We encourage preservation professionals to take seriously the concept of intersectionality, which acknowledges the multivalent quality of lived experience, addresses the complexity of identity, and recognizes the multiplicity of communities with a stake in the preservation and interpretation of any given historic property. This essay argues for the strategic importance of learning from recent studies of LGBTQ resources to refine intersectional approaches to preservation planning, while identifying hidden barriers to inclusion and cultural equity in programs and projects that use a single lens to identify cultural resources associated with underrepresented groups.

AB Racism in medicine affects patients, trainees, and practitioners and contributes to health care inequities. An effective strategy to actively oppose the structural racism ingrained in the fabric of medicine is to intentionally and systematically address diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in medical education and research. As part of ARMED MedEd, a new longitudinal cohort course in advanced research methods in medical education, sponsored by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the leadership team deliberately included a nested DEI curriculum. The goal of the DEI curriculum is to reduce bias in development, recruitment, and implementation of education research studies to promote equity and inclusion in medical education, research, and ultimately, patient care. A team of medical educators with expertise in DEI developed curricular elements focusing on DEI in education research. The two major components are a didactic curriculum (including implicit bias training) to teach researchers to consider equity as they design studies and a consultative service to refine research protocols to address lingering unintended bias. A dedicated focus on DEI can be incorporated into an advanced education research methodology course to raise awareness and provide tools to avoid bias in research design and implementation of interventions. Over time, the network of education researchers who are trained in DEI awareness will grow and provide equitable offerings to their learners to mitigate health inequities.

AB In an effort to pursue and achieve quality and equity in science education, the South African National Curriculum Statement stipulates that learners should be accorded an opportunity to acquire and apply knowledge and skills in meaningful ways. Accordingly, the curriculum promotes knowledge in both local and global contexts. The study investigated how teachers' knowledge of learners' socio-cultural backgrounds is invoked in enacting various teaching and learning approaches that bring relevance of science to learners. Three science teachers from three township high schools were observed teaching while incorporating learners' socio-cultural practices, experiences and beliefs when teaching the topics reproduction, nutrition and healthy diet. The teachers were interviewed after each lesson via a closed-ended protocol. Science local curriculum documents and lesson plans were also analysed. A total of five lesson observations and five post-lesson interviews per teacher were analysed using the constant comparative method. The findings revealed that teachers use probing and open-ended questions, argumentation in groups, authentic problem-solving activities and resources, examples, experiences and language familiar to learners. Such practices promote class and group interaction, develop critical and analytical thinking skills in learners and promote conceptual understanding. The research findings provide insights into how certain science topics can be taught in meaningful ways to socio-economically and culturally diverse learners, which can contribute to the current debate on relevant education in a country faced with huge diversity.

TI Brownfields: A case study in partnering with residents to develop an
   easy-to-read print guide
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB At least three cultural circumstances have converged to make environmental health information critical, yet highly inaccessible, to many Americans: 1) the declining literacy levels of almost half the population, 2) the growing cultural diversity of the population, and 3) the complexity of environmental health information and science. This paper presents a case study of how literacy experts and environmental scientists partnered with a panel of inner-city residents to produce a community guide about brownfields, a process the authors refer to as "cooperative com posing." The goal was to create low-barrier material (fifth-through eighth-grade reading level) that would inform people about brownfields issues so that they can meaningfully insert themselves into the process of planning for brownfields reuse and redevelopment.
   The authors structured an ongoing process with a panel of residents to learn with them just what types of information they wanted and what language level and graphics were appropriate. A primary motivator of this study was the belief that informed, activated residents will bring about greater equity and collaboration in environmental planning for brownfields.

AB Urbanization, a characteristic of the twentieth century, is a profound transformation of human settlement processes and their outcomes, which has not been well understood in terms of both positive and negative impacts. This paper argues that the interrelations between urban planning, health, social, and environmental policies have been poorly articulated until now. Although sectoral approaches have often applied remedial and corrective measures to overcome unsatisfactory conditions in urban areas, today we know that infectious diseases stemming from insanitary conditions are not the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe. Nonetheless diverse forms of ill health remain associated with place of work and residence. Therefore, in order to deal with the complexity and diversity of urban areas there is an urgent need to move from conventional, sectoral approaches based on biomedical models of health to coordinated action stemming from an ecological interpretation of health including its social determinants. This kind of approach is presented in order to promote health and social development at the local level.

TI Student body racial and ethnic composition and diversity-related
   outcomes in US medical schools

DT Article
ID CULTURAL COMPETENCE; EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; IMPACT; POLICY
AB Context Many medical schools assert that a racially and ethnically diverse student body is an important element in educating physicians to meet the needs of a diverse society. However, there is limited evidence addressing the educational effects of student body racial diversity.
   Objective To determine whether student body racial and ethnic diversity is associated with diversity- related outcomes among US medical students.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A Web- based survey ( Graduation Questionnaire) administered by the Association of American Medical Colleges of 20 112 graduating medical students ( 64% of all graduating students in 2003 and 2004) from 118 allopathic medical schools in the United States. Historically black and Puerto Rican medical schools were excluded.
   Main Outcome Measures Students' self- rated preparedness to care for patients from other racial and ethnic backgrounds, attitudes about equity and access to care, and intent to practice in an underserved area.
   Results White students within the highest quintile for student body racial and ethnic diversity, measured by the proportion of underrepresented minority ( URM) students, were more likely to rate themselves as highly prepared to care for minority populations than those in the lowest diversity quintile ( 61.1% vs 53.9%, respectively; P <. 001; adjusted odds ratio [ OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 1.13- 1.57). This association was strongest in schools in which students perceived a positive climate for interracial interaction. White students in the highest URM quintile were also more likely to have strong attitudes endorsing equitable access to care ( 54.8% vs 44.2%, respectively; P <. 001; adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15- 1.74). For nonwhite students, after adjustment there were no significant associations between student body URM proportions and diversity- related outcomes. Student body URM proportions were not associated with white or nonwhite students' plans to practice in underserved communities, although URM students were substantially more likely than white or nonwhite/ non- URM students to plan to serve the underserved ( 48.7% vs 18.8% vs 16.2%, respectively; P <. 001).
   Conclusion Student body racial and ethnic diversity within US medical schools is associated with outcomes consistent with the goal of preparing students to meet the needs of a diverse population.

AB The Association of Academic Physiatrists (AAP) convened a women's task force in 2016, and the members agreed on a list of metrics that would permit retrospective data review pertaining to the representation and inclusion of women physicians in the society. Examples of categories examined included leadership positions (i.e., board membership, board presidents, committee membership, committee chairs, and resident fellow physician chairs), conference presentations (i.e., annual meeting session proposals, annual meeting faculty, annual meeting plenary speakers), and recognition awards (i.e., recognition award nominations and recipients). The findings highlight areas in which the Association of Academic Physiatrists has been successful in supporting gender equity and other areas in which women physiatrists have been underrepresented. The task force worked with the Board of Trustees to construct an action plan, asking the respective committees to address areas of underrepresentation. A volunteer from each committee was deemed a diversity steward and going forward will work directly with the task force as a liaison to document an action plan and collect data. The board plans to transparently report progress to members and other stakeholders, and the task force aims to publish a follow-up report within the next 5 years.

AB This article first presents a study of two educational researchers' history and curriculum of colonialism. Using a process of duoethnography, we engage in dialogic and collaborative personal ethnographies in which we contrast and analyze critical educational incidents and products (e. g., a high school report card, old personal photos, and current teaching lesson plans at the high school and college levels). We focus this process on the ideological scripts framing and informing our educational histories, as students and then as teachers, in order to unpack some of the cultural underpinnings of our views of teaching language arts for equity and diversity. Furthermore, in the article we critique the duoethnographic process, analyzing and discussing issues surrounding representation, trustworthiness, and self-reflexivity.

AB The purpose of the current research is to introduce a new method involving machine learning that can identify and analyse the city image dimensions (CIDs) of cities worldwide. Unlike traditional methods, this new method can rapidly identify city image dimensions from large sets of user-generated photos in an efficient and scalable manner, which could help city managers more effectively plan city branding strategies and city development policies. Label detection with Google Cloud Vision and dimension identification (or topic extraction) with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modelling were used to analyse 222,000 photos of 222 cities worldwide from Flickr.com. Theoretically, this study reinforces the existing literature using Big Data, presents alternative ways to identify CIDs, and illustrates diversity within the image dimensions.

AB With principles of respect to the protection and implementation of human rights, cultural, ethnic and racial diversity and also the promotion of equity, the Stork Network ensures the right to reproductive planning and continued provision of care in maternal and child health. This study sought to evaluate the Active Ombudsman Survey of the Stork Network conducted with women who had their births assisted by the Unified Health System (SUS) in 2012, in order to analyze ethnic/racial differences in prenatal and childbirth care. This descriptive study used the secondary database from the survey conducted by the SUS Ombudsman. The universe of this investigation was constituted by 253,647 women, and 50.8% self-declared themselves as brown, 35.4% white, 10.6% black 2.1% yellow, 0.6% Indians and for 0.5% race/color was not informed. Women of black/brown race appear to be worse off in socioeconomic characteristics, prenatal and childbirth care, in all variables studied, except concerning aggression and supplementary payment. Knowledge about inequalities and vulnerability of this group may serve to alert society and the government, and as a guideline for the development of policies and actions to reduce health inequalities.

DT Article
DE Ethnicity; Recruitment; Psychiatry; Diversity; URM
AB Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hindered medical student career planning and clinical rotations. Recruitment and networking may be more influential in match outcomes than previous cycles. Medical residency training programs have significant challenges in recruiting diverse applicants. The American Psychiatric Association's Black Caucus developed a virtual recruitment event for residency programs with robust diversity initiatives and underrepresented medical students. This article evaluates our methods, short-term results, and influence on participating medical students. Methods The authors sent web-based invitations to all programs subscribed to the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training listserv. Programs that demonstrated intention and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion were selected. The authors used various social media platforms and the Black Caucus listserv to advertise to medical students. Student participants received an online feedback survey consisting of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Results Thirty-six programs and one hundred seven medical students participated in the 2-day diversity fair. Seventy-six students completed the following survey, which is a response rate of 71%. A majority of students reported that this event strongly influenced their interest in a program (71.05) and are actively considering a residency program they had not previously considered (69.74). A majority of medical students (89.47) strongly agreed that program representatives treated them with professionalism and respect. Conclusion This event improved communication between highly valued underrepresented minority students applicants and residency programs. A notable majority of participants found the program overwhelmingly beneficial.

This is directly relevant to disabled people in Africa, which is the focus of this article. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities delineates the principles of inclusion in society. Furthermore, the African Union (AU) plays a key role in advising its Member States about disability issues, and this advice should be reflected in disability-inclusive policies. This article analyses nine policy or strategy documents produced by the AU, covering the policy domains of education, health, employment and social protection that are crucial to the inclusion of disabled people in international development. These were analysed according to seven discrete elements (rights, accessibility, inclusivity, implementation plans, budgetary allocations, enforcement mechanisms or disaggregated management information systems) using a rating scale of one to four, with four being the highest level of inclusion. The process (for example, level of consultation), the context (for example, the Sustainable Development Goals) and actors involved in the policy development were reviewed as far as was possible from the documents. None of the policies reached even 50% of the total possible score, indicating poor levels of genuine inclusion. Rights scored a highest rating, but still at a low level. This suggests that there is recognition of the rights of disabled people to inclusion, but this is not generally integrated within inclusive implementation plans, budgetary allocations, enforcement mechanisms or disaggregated management information systems for monitoring. The limited socio-economic inclusion of disability within AU policies is a lost opportunity that should be reviewed and rectified. The findings have broader ramifications for the non-tokenistic and genuine involvement of poor and marginalized groups in the international policy-making arena.

TI State domination in Singapore's public-private partnerships
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Within U.S. cities, public-private partnerships (PPPs) consisting of government agencies and property developers have been dominated by the profit-driven goals of the private partners. In sharp contrast, Singapore's PPPs are state dominated and aligned with general policy goals. As elsewhere, they are project specific and oriented toward promoting economic development as well as housing construction. This article discusses Singapore's governance model and examines 3 examples of PPPs there. It shows that state land ownership and investments limit the leeway of the private partners and that the impetus for the project as a rule comes from public agencies. In relation to principles of justice-defined here as equity, democracy, and diversity-the projects ensure that gains will be realized by the public sector and that housing will be socially integrated. Failures of equity, however, are involved in the lack of rights for the foreign construction workers building the projects, while the exclusion of the public from the planning process constitutes a failure of democracy. In sum, then, PPPs in Singapore show that public land ownership gives the public sector control over the distribution of benefits within PPPs but, at the same time, the government's decision making, for better and worse, is relatively unchecked.

AB European countries show substantial variation in family policy and in the extent to which policies support more traditional male-breadwinner or more gender egalitarian earner-carer family arrangements. Using data from the European Social Survey, the authors implemented multilevel models to analyze variation in fertility intentions of 16,000 men and women according to individual-level characteristics and family policy across 21 European countries. Both traditional and earner-carer family support generosity were positively related to first-birth intentions for men and women. In contrast, only earner-carer support maintains its positive relationship with second birth intentions. Family policy is not in general related to third and higher order parity intentions.

AB Real estate markets have an important role attracting a growing number of international investors, which is why the demand for reliable classification urban systems will continue to grow and become an essential tool in the process of investment planning. The paper showed a possible application of spatial analysis to capitalization rate determination and risk premium maps. While literature is normally focused on the cap rate determination and his linkage with time series and with models such as band of investment analysis and their relationship with the equity determination, in this work a spatial approach to cap rate and risk premium determination is proposed. The analyses was conducted on the basis of transaction Italian residential properties from 2014 to 2015. In order to define a spatial relationship between cap rates and spatial distribution, a Kriging application was proposed.

TI Henry George and Jane Jacobs on the Sources of Economic Growth
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Henry George and Jane Jacobs shared a remarkably similar vision of the economic functioning of cities and of the sources of the economic growth of cities, despite having differing primary objectives. George wrote Progress and Poverty and subsequent works to persuade the public of the equity and efficiency of public capture of economic rents of land and other natural resources and elimination of taxes on labor and capital. Jacobs acquired fame for The Death and Life of Great American Cities in which she challenged the prevailing orthodoxy of the urban planning profession. Both saw the density and diversity of economic and cultural activities in cities as a facilitator of innovation and entrepreneurship in all aspects of civilization. Both also recognized the power of the price system in coordinating the activities of independent decision makers and the importance of trade for economic growth.

AB BackgroundUndernutrition causes around 3.1 million child deaths annually, around 45% of all child deaths. India has one of the highest proportions of maternal and child undernutrition globally. To accelerate reductions in undernutrition, nutrition-specific interventions need to be coupled with nutrition-sensitive programmes that tackle the underlying causes of undernutrition. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of the UPAVAN trial, a four-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial that tests the nutritional and agricultural impacts of an innovative agriculture extension platform of women's groups viewing videos on nutrition-sensitive agriculture practices, coupled with a nutrition-specific behaviour-change intervention of videos on nutrition, and a participatory learning and action approach.MethodsThe economic evaluation of the UPAVAN interventions will be conducted from a societal perspective, taking into account all costs incurred by the implementing agency (programme costs), community and health care providers, and participants and their households, and all measurable outcomes associated with the interventions. All direct and indirect costs, including time costs and donated goods, will be estimated. The economic evaluation will take the form of a cost-consequence analysis, comparing incremental costs and incremental changes in the outcomes of the interventions, compared with the status quo. Robustness of the results will be assessed through a series of sensitivity analyses. In addition, an analysis of the equity impact of the interventions will be conducted.DiscussionEvidence on the cost and cost-effectiveness of nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions is scarce. This limits understanding of the costs of rolling out or scaling up programs. The findings of this economic evaluation will provide useful information for different multisectoral stakeholders involved in the planning and implementation of nutrition-sensitive agriculture programmes.Trial registrationISRCTN65922679.

AB The energy poverty cycle continues to pose a major challenge for governments in emerging economies. Electrification has typically been delivered through centralised generation and distribution that has not always afforded equitable or efficient access. Decentralised solar technologies are fast approaching financial parity and have certain environmental advantages over grid extension, especially in rural and remote societies. We explore the emergence of decentralised energy systems in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populated state with notable energy access and equity challenges. We suggest future electrification policies and strategies should be based on the principles of diversity in technology use, localised implementation and centralised planning and enforcement to address energy poverty conundrum in the state of Uttar Pradesh or similar economies.

AB The complexity and diversity of the cultural offering in cities on a global scale is increasingly evident and raises the need for considering further implications of this complexity in urban planning and city branding strategies. The purpose of this research is to deepen the understanding of the key elements, perceptions and experiences associated to the cultural dimension of a city brand, using the case of Madrid as one of the top urban destinations with an extensive cultural offer and cultural consumption options. The urban cultural appeal matrix, built on the main conclusions of the research, contributes to mapping cities according to their prominence in either hard or soft and global or local elements of their cultural offer. The proposed mapping can be relevant for the identification of the cultural profile of any urban destination.

AB Background: The low quality of healthcare and the presence of user fees in Burkina Faso contribute to low utilization of healthcare and elevated levels of mortality. To improve access to high-quality healthcare and equity, national authorities are testing different intervention arms that combine performance-based financing with community-based health insurance and pro-poor targeting. There is a need to evaluate the implementation of these unique approaches. We developed a research protocol to analyze the conditions that led to the emergence of these intervention arms, the fidelity between the activities initially planned and those conducted, the implementation and adaptation processes, the sustainability of the interventions, the possibilities for scaling them up, and their ethical implications.
   Methods/Design: The study adopts a longitudinal multiple case study design with several embedded levels of analyses. To represent the diversity of contexts where the intervention arms are carried out, we will select three districts. Within districts, we will select both primary healthcare centers (n = 18) representing different intervention arms and the district or regional hospital (n = 3). We will select contrasted cases in relation to their initial performance (good, fair, poor). Over a period of 18 months, we will use quantitative and qualitative data collection and analytical tools to study these cases including in-depth interviews, participatory observation, research diaries, and questionnaires. We will give more weight to qualitative methods compared to quantitative methods.
   Discussion: Performance-based financing is expanding rapidly across low-and middle-income countries. The results of this study will enable researchers and decision makers to gain a better understanding of the factors that can influence the implementation and the sustainability of complex interventions aiming to increase healthcare quality as well as equity.

AB "Access and allocation" is one of the five analytical problems identified as key for analysing earth system governance in the first Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan officially published in 2009. Ten years later and with a new Science and Implementation Plan in place, it is time to take stock. Therefore, this paper addresses the question: What does a decadal review of the Earth System Governance literature tell us about how to conceptualize and define access and allocation, what ethical norms and epistemologies underlie access and allocation research, and what does Earth System Governance scholarship reveal about the interplay between access and allocation and other norms? We find that: (a) there is a relatively small body of the Earth System Governance literature on access and allocation, albeit growing; (b) this literature is largely empirical and dispersed across a variety of topics; and (c) there is a diversity of ethical norms and principles emphasized in Earth System Governance scholarship, but the dynamics between different forms of access and related implications for allocation are relatively underexplored. In light of these findings and with a new Earth System Governance Science and Implementation Plan in place, this paper highlights key areas for further research and development.

DT Article
ID TEACHERS; DIVERSITY; EQUITY
AB This study represents a first iteration in the design process of the Growing Awareness Inventory (GAIn), a structured observation protocol for building the awareness of preservice teachers (PSTs) for resources in mathematics and science classrooms that can be used for culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP). The GAIn is designed to develop awareness of: how students use language in classrooms; relationships between teacher questioning patterns and student participation; messages conveyed by the classroom environment; and ways to incorporate students' interests into lesson plans. The methodology took the form of a multiple case study design with fourteen mathematics PSTs as one case and five science PSTs as the other case. The participants' response to the GAIn and lesson plans served as data sources. Findings reveal that the GAIn scaffolded PSTs' awareness of their students, their own attitudes, and several elements of CRP. However, there were key areas of CRP that were neither explored with the GAIn nor identified by the participants. Consistent with design-based research, outcomes include a design framework for revision of the GAIn and a theory of action that situates it within a teacher education course that includes a field placement.

AB Women are under-represented as leaders of cardiovascular randomized controlled trials, representing 1 in 10 lead authors of cardiovascular trials published in high-impact journals. Although the proportion of cardiovascular specialists who are women has increased in recent years, the proportion of cardiovascular clinical trialists who are women has not. This gap, underpinned by systemic sexism, has not been adequately addressed. The benefits of diverse randomized controlled trial leadership extend to patients and professionals. In this position statement, we present strategies adopted by some organizations to end gender inequality in research leadership. We offer an actionable roadmap for early-career researchers, scientists, academic institutions, professional societies, trial sponsors, and journals to follow, with the goal of harnessing the strength of women and under-represented groups as research leaders and facilitating a just culture in the cardiovascular clinical trial enterprise.

AB The goal of this research is to identify science teachers' beliefs and conceptions that play an important role in shaping their understandings of and attempts to enact inclusive science teaching practices. We examined the work products, both informal (online discussions, email exchanges) and formal (papers, unit plans, peer reviews), of 14 teachers enrolled in a master's degree course focused on diversity in science teaching and learning. These emerging understandings were member-checked via a series of interviews with a subset of these teachers. Our analysis was conducted in two stages: (1) describing the difficulties the teachers identified for themselves in their attempts to teach science to a wide range of students in their classes and (2) analyzing these self-identified barriers for underlying beliefs and conceptions that serve to prohibit or allow for the teachers' understanding and enactment of equitable science instruction. The teachers' self-identified barriers were grouped into three categories: students, broader social infrastructure, and self. The more fundamental barriers identified included teacher beliefs about the ethnocentrism of the mainstream, essentialism/individualism, and beliefs about the meritocracy of schooling. The implications of these hurdles for science teacher education are discussed.

AB This study explores factors contributing to the uneven success of past expansions of dock-based public bike-sharing systems, in which middle- and - higher-income neighborhoods have tended to benefit considerably more than poorer neighborhoods. After a review of the differing performance of the three phases of expansion by Chicago's Divvy bikeshare system, this study uses multivariate adaptive regression splining (MARS) to select among more than 100 community- and station-level factors to explain variations in Divvy system usage at the station level. MARS demonstrates that neighborhood racial and ethnic diversity, proportion of condominium units, and job accessibility to public transit are strongly and positively correlated with total annual station trips, whereas percentage unemployed, average distance to Divvy stations, and percentage of residential foreclosures are negatively correlated. Model results are compared with those of earlier studies to foster insights into ways to more accurately predict the use of bikesharing systems across urban neighborhoods.

AB Gender biases contribute to the underrepresentation of women in STEM. In response, the scientific community has called for methods to reduce bias, but few validated interventions exist. Thus, an interdisciplinary group of researchers and filmmakers partnered to create VIDS (Video Interventions for Diversity in STEM), which are short videos that expose participants to empirical findings from published gender bias research in 1 of 3 conditions. One condition illustrated findings using narratives (compelling stories), and the second condition presented the same results using expert interviews (straightforward facts). A hybrid condition included both narrative and expert interview videos. Results of two experiments revealed that relative to controls, VIDS successfully reduced gender bias and increased awareness of gender bias, positive attitudes toward women in STEM, anger, empathy, and intentions to engage in behaviors that promote gender parity in STEM. The narratives were particularly impactful for emotions, while the expert interviews most strongly impacted awareness and attitudes. The hybrid condition reflected the strengths of both the narratives and expert interviews (though effects were sometimes slightly weaker than the other conditions). VIDS produced substantial immediate effects among both men and women in the general population and STEM faculty, and effects largely persisted at follow-up.

AB In 2015, President Obama announced plans for the Precision Medicine Initiative (R) (PMI), an ambitious longitudinal project aimed at revolutionizing medicine. Integral to this Initiative is the recruitment of over one million Americans into a volunteer research cohort, the All of Us(SM) Research Program. The announcement has generated much excitement but absent is a discussion of how the All of Us Research Program-to be implemented within the context of social realities of mass incarcerations and racial disparities in criminal justice and healthcare-might excaberate health disparities. We examine how attainment of Initiative's stated goals of reflecting the diversity of the American population and including all who are interested in participating might be impeded by regulatory and administrative barriers to the involvement of participants who become incarcerated during longitudinal studies. Changes have been proposed to the federal policy for human subjects research protections, but current regulations and administrative policies-developed under a protectionist paradigm in response to scandalous research practices with confined populations-dramatically limit research involving prisoners. Our review provides rationale for the development of Initiative policies that anticipate recruitment and retention obstacles that might frustrate inclusivity and exacerbate health disparities. Furthermore, we question the effective ban on biomedical and behavioral research involving prisoners and advocate for regulatory reforms that restore participatory research rights of prisoners. Disparities in health and justice are intertwined, and without regulatory reforms to facilitate participatory research rights of prisoners and careful planning of viable and responsible recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies, Initiative could miss discovery opportunities, exacerbate health disparities, and increase levels of distrust in science.

TI Hospital Leadership Diversity and Strategies to Advance Health Equity
SO JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Diversity in hospital leadership is often valued as important for achieving clinical excellence. The American Hospital Association surveyed hospitals about their actions to identify and address health disparities. The survey asked about the degree of representation of racial and ethnic minorities and women among executives and board members.
   Methods: The survey contained 78 items in four domains: Leadership and Strategic Planning, Workforce, Data Collection, and Reducing Disparities. All items were standardized and pooled within each domain to construct four variables. Logistic regression models were used to assess the difference in domain scores, for each domain, between hospitals with (a) high and low representation of people of color in the C-suite, (b) high and low representation of women in the corporate (C-) suite, (c) high and low representation of people of color on the board, and (d) high and low representation of women on the board.
   Results: Hospitals with more diverse boards with respect to race and ethnicity had significantly higher scores for all domains, indicating that these hospitals were pursuing substantially more strategies in all domains. In contrast, more racially and ethnically diverse executive suites were associated only with the Data Collection domain, while hospitals with a higher percentage of women in executive positions had lower scores for all domains except Data Collection.
   Conclusion: Hospitals with greater representation of racial and ethnic minorities in leadership positions had greater commitments to diversity initiatives. However, hospitals with women-particularly white women-in leadership positions reported fewer diversity initiatives. Future research is needed to examine the mechanisms and causality behind these associations.

AB The purpose of the paper is to describe the process of recruiting and retaining faculty of color to diversify the faculty in Engineering Technology programs and to enhance an already good experience that many traditional faculty members bring to the classroom. This paper will address the process that East Tennessee State University uses to target highly qualifies faculty of color to an institution located in an area were race and culture may not be as diverse as in other areas of the country.
   The problem this paper addresses is the low representation of minority faculty members in academic departments at ETSU, including Engineering Technology, Surveying and Digital Media. Faculty searches have failed to identify diverse applicant pools for a significant number of faculty positions. Because of the University's history and location it is still operating under affirmative action policies.
   What has been learned is that despite national efforts to increase the number of African American Ph.D's, the traditional decentralized hiring process under the authority of academic departments is not producing the needed results. This is the case even in states with public higher education systems under court monitored diversity goal as outlined in the university strategic plan regarding faculty of color. In addition, it is extremely important that ownership and accountability in in place to make sure goals are being met. Without this in place, diversity of faculty will not be realized.
   Additional funding, the establishment of benchmarks, staffing, an operational link to the Office of Equity and Diversity and training for all search committee members will be required, especially chairs of the committees.

AB Nature-based solutions are proliferating in European cities over the past years as viable solutions to urban challenges such as climate change, urban degeneration and aging infrastructures. With evidence amounting about nature-based solutions, there is a need to translate knowledge about nature-based solutions to future policy and planning. In this paper, we analysed fifteen cases of nature-based solutions' experiments across 11 European cities. What makes our case studies stand out is the balanced focus between ecosystem and social benefits in contrast to many published cases on nature-based solutions that have a weighted focus on the climate benefits. From a cross-case comparative analysis we draw seven overarching lessons related to all stages of proof-of-concept and implementation of nature-based solutions in cities: (a) nature-based solutions need to be aesthetically appealing to citizens, (b) nature-based solutions create new green urban commons, (c) experimenting with nature-based solutions requires trust in the local government and in experimentation process itself, (d) co-creation of nature-based solutions requires diversity and learning from social innovation, (e) nature-based solutions require collaborative governance, (f) an inclusive narrative of mission for nature-based solutions can enable integration to many urban agendas and (g) design nature-based solutions so as to learn and replicate them on the long-term. The lessons we draw show that nature-based solutions require multiple disciplines for their design, diversity (of settings) for co-creation and recognition of the place-based transformative potential of nature-based solutions as 'superior' to grey infrastructure. We further discern that urban planners need to have an open approach to collaborative governance of nature-based solutions that allows learning with and about new appealing designs, perceptions and images of nature from different urban actors, allows forming of new institutions for operating and maintaining nature-based solutions to ensure inclusivity, livability and resilience.

LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Neoliberal education policy; performativity; UAE; moral education;
   curriculum design and implementation; values-based learning; wellbeing
AB Testing explanations of 'neoliberalism in education', this article explores whether neoliberal policy facilitates curricula that include moral development for the 'common good', or whether unintended consequences actually eviscerate the very nature of moral education. England's contribution to curriculum design in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has set planning within broadly accepted 'market' philosophies drawn from the 'reforms' of the 1980s. Reactionary implementation of moral education as an additional separate, statutory and tested subject into an already crowded curriculum in the UAE raises questions over authenticity, relevance and quality. The global economic and diplomatic influence of the UAE is high and rising, with similar trends for other economies in the region. However, as elsewhere, issues about inclusivity, equality, diversity, identity and wellbeing are pressing curricula content, particularly around values in personal, social, moral, environmental and economic responsibility, and 'the historical record'. Building upon lessons in the authoritative account, Development of moral education in the UAE: lessons to be learned (Pring, R. 2018. "Development of Moral Education in the UAE: Lessons to Be Learned." Oxford Review of Education. doi:10.1080/03054985.2018.1502169), the paper seeks reconciliation away from ranked performance measures and compartmentalised subject additions and towards greater cross-curricula integration, critical thinking and moral action.

AB "Somos Latinxs" is a statement about the importance of centering theoretical and empirical writings on the social and behavioral health conditions of sexual and gender diverse (SOD) Latinxs. This special issue offers the first publication devoted to SGD communities in a flagship journal of a national ethnic minority psychological association and is a major step forward in representation and validation of the unique intersectional lived experiences of SGD people of color. Each paper in this special issue provides an opportunity to imagine future possibilities with topics that include: (a) Latinx as a gender-affirmative identity label, (b) the active use of nonverbal and contextual disclosure strategies. (c) understanding how both ethnic and SGD discrimination are linked with mental health in SGD Latinx youth, (d) exploring how intersectional minority stress is experienced, as well as coping strategies used to combat it, and (e) intersectional and collective leadership practices. The overarching goal of this special issue is to forge new pathways that foster authenticity of SGD Latinxs lived experiences by illuminating and honoring how race and ethnicity, sexual orientation. and gender identity, in addition to many other social factors, intersect to create dynamic cultural experiences linked to psychological outcomes. In this introduction, an overview of the events leading to this special issue are presented as well as a discussion of intersectionality theory, the conceptual model guiding the articles featured in this special issue.

TI Multispecies Coastal Shelf Recovery Plan: A Collaborative,
   Ecosystem-Based Approach
SO MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID GULF
AB This article explains the integration of an ecosystem into a collaborative management plan to restore New England's depleted multispecies groundfish stocks and decimated coastal fishery. Applying lessons learned from Maine's successful fishery for lobsters Homarus americanus, the Downeast Groundfish Initiative (an eclectic group of fishermen, scientists, and concerned individuals) created a new groundfish management approach designed to nest seamlessly within existing federal and state management systems and be compatible with a total allowable catch (TAC) approach, though it does not require TAC as the primary management tool. The plan resolves fine-scale issues affecting the fishery's biological productivity and addresses the economic, social, and cultural factors confronting fishing communities. The inadequacy of systemwide assessments in detecting local changes in marine ecosystems led to the creation of smaller, contiguous coastal shelf management units each of which encompasses the subpopulation of a key species such as Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. Each unit would have an inshore core layer encompassing the species' spawning grounds and nursery habitats while providing a limited, small-scale fishery for local fishermen using selective, habitat-friendly gear. A buffer layer outside the core area that brackets coastal shelf migration routes would also support a fishery using all legal gear types but with constraints, and an outer layer would provide a fishery operating under current federal regulations. The core and buffer areas would be collaboratively managed to enhance local stock recovery by local advisory councils of fishermen functioning under state administration and regional council oversight. The coastal shelf plan synchronizes the needs of coastal ecosystems and fishermen by restoring species diversity and protecting critical habitats while rebuilding commercial stocks. The approach can create robust, sustainable fisheries for all user groups, resolve equity issues among fishermen, and revitalize the economies of fishing communities of all sizes.

ID PLANS; LIFE
AB While active ageing has emerged as a main strategy to address the challenges of population ageing in Europe, recent research has stressed the need to increase knowledge on within-country differences to promote active ageing through appropriate policy responses. This article draws on the Active Ageing Index (AAI) to capture recent trends in active ageing in Italy with a focus on sub-national diversity. To this end, we compute AAI breakdowns by region separately for men and women for four different years: 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2018. Then, we use linear regression to describe the geographical and sex-specific patterns of change in the AAI over the considered period. The results demonstrate the diversity of regional outcomes and trends in the active ageing of Italian men and women, indicating that the widening geographic gap deserves further consideration by national and regional authorities in designing and implementing active ageing policies. By showing the persistence of disparities in the value of the indicator to the disadvantage of women, results also suggest the need to further integrate both the gender dimension and the life-cycle perspective into active ageing strategies. This article provides an example of how the AAI can be used as a practical tool by policy makers to monitor active ageing trends and outcomes at the sub-national level, and to identify target areas that require further action.

AB The 2016 U.S. presidential election brought to light longstanding tensions and bigotry across the country that were further exacerbated when Donald Trump won the presidency on November 8th. While college and university leaders have traditionally refrained from commenting on election results, looming concerns of possible campus protests and external pressures sparked institutional responses. This study considers an analysis of these responses including 48 statements from 28 public and private colleges and universities throughout the nation. Using critical discourse analysis, the authors find that despite seemingly inclusive language, most higher education leaders used symbolic discourse that preserved existing power structures rather than employing transformative language that could lead to materialized, actionable support for the students most impacted by divisive campaign rhetoric as well as the laws and policies that have followed. As politically marginalized students are impacted in serious ways by federal and state policies under the current administration, the trend of campus-wide communication from university leaders must refrain from status-quo rhetoric to instead transform institutions of higher education to not only serve, but protect, targeted students.

TI Increasing Trust in Health Care COMMENT
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Trust in American health care and in the people running medical institutions is in decline, which poses a threat to the physician-patient relationship. In response, the ABIM Foundation has established the Building Trust initiative, which includes the Trust Practices Network, advancing research in trust, leadership convening, and various communications vehicles. The Trust Practices Network includes hospitals and health systems, specialty societies, health plans, consumer organizations, employers, and others who are working to reaffirm and strengthen trust as a pillar in their own missions. Participants offer examples of how they have built trust, and their contributions have illuminated 4 dimensions of trust: competency, caring, communication, and comfort. This commentary discusses an exemplary practice for each of these dimensions and describes the "positive deviance" strategy that underlies the Trust Practices Network. It also offers an overview of the other elements of Building Trust, such as a grant program to promote trust as well as diversity, equity, and inclusion in internal medicine education, and an effort to spur additional research on trust.

AB The ability of urban parks and public spaces to address distrust and social isolation needs to be rigorously tested, as the predominance of such claims may crowd out discussions of environmental racism and structural inequality. This study tested some commonly stated claims about parks' influence on social well-being using a survey of residents in St. Louis, Missouri. We tested relationships between park and public space visitation frequency, positive and negative social contact with people of other races/ethnicities, and trust, using structural equation modeling. The model had strong fit but had few significant paths, indicating assertions are not fully supported by our data. Recommendations for urban park planners, managers, and community advocates include improving the design and planning process to accommodate diverse users, as well as modifying their discourse to reflect the growing need for social equity.

ID EDUCATION; MODEL
AB This article draws from ethnographic data collected during a 23-month-language socialization study of mixed-status Mexican families living in the New Latino Diaspora. The analysis focuses on the ways in which siblings in one family talk about citizenship during a discursive event that I call the Planning for the Future Routine. The findings show that siblings communicate two key understandings during everyday conversations: first, the relevance of migratory status to their day-to-day lives and second, their family's shared conventions for talking about citizenship status in the home. As children and youth demonstrate the social norms for talking about citizenship, they also express their understanding of the ways that being a United States or Mexican citizen shapes their future opportunities. A nuanced understanding of intrafamily diversity and learning experiences can strengthen educators', researchers', and policy makers' ability to advocate for Latino communities' well-being and educational equity.

AB This paper makes a contribution to the suburban retrofit/sprawl repair literature by suggesting a method that planners can use to evaluate the potential of some places to be catalysts for an improved more sustainable urban form. The strategy is aimed at evaluating and then promoting sustainable urban form in unsustainable places. The method puts sprawl retrofit projects into a larger planning framework, suggesting ways to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of places in relative terms, taking into account how different kinds of nodes-from light rail stops to parking lots-varying with respect to sustainable urban form characteristics. Overlaying data on accessibility, density, diversity, and connectivity reveals areas with varying levels of sustainable urban form. Intervention in potential retrofit locations consists of neighborhood and site-scale design, including suggestions for code reform, intensification of land use around nodes, public investment in civic space, traffic calming, and incentives for private development.

AB Occupational therapy focuses on therapeutic means to address participation in meaningful everyday tasks across the lifespan. No single setting is more conducive to this pursuit than individuals' authentic contexts. Occupational therapists are therefore uniquely suited to lead the charge toward stimulating research and advancing evidence-based application of telehealth. To this end, the American Occupational Therapy Foundation digitally convened their 2020 Planning Grant Collective to focus on the topic of Telehealth. Participants of the interdisciplinary collective collaboratively identified four themes: (1) Using technology to assess and intervene in the everyday context, (2) Partnerships with caregivers, (3) Telehealth delivery, and (4) Uniform data collection. Subgroups explored potential research and funding opportunities in their specialty area while also addressing the centralizing concepts of equity and diversity of telehealth delivery and COVID-19. Here, we provide a summary of the key concepts and recommendations from the 3 days of collaboration.

AB This article discusses the relevance of the HfG Ulm discourse to the notions of Sustainable Design. The Ulmer programme included values such as social equity, resource optimisation and respect for the planet and the environment, which are main pillars for Sustainable Design practices. Links between the HfG's ideas of the '60s and contemporary sustainable design values could be examined by comparing historical and recent discourses. The text presents topics that the compared discussions share such as environmental concern, social sustainability (social needs, distribution), systems perspective, resilience, diversity, planned obsolescence, behaviour and culture, and the perspective of design as a constructive activity. The HfG experience could be used today, given a proper translation from historical approaches applied to the state of current affairs. The comprehension of the Ulmer discourse can contribute to building the future design knowledge, possibly creating frameworks that will allow better sustainability practices.

DT Article
DE Culture; sexual diversity; gender diversity; Christianity; practical
   justice
AB Cultural values and practices influence many aspects of sexual and reproductive health and rights - from access to and quality of health education and services, to gender roles and responsibilities, to family planning and sexual freedoms. Culture is frequently marginalised in epidemiologically driven analyses of sexual and reproductive health and rights yet remains central to the ways in which inequalities within these fields manifest themselves and are engaged with in society. Using Papua New Guinea (PNG) as a case example, this paper sheds light on the enabling and restrictive role of culture in efforts to work towards equity and justice for gender and sexually diverse people. Drawing on four case stories, we offer insight into where culture can and has been deployed to redress serious inequalities in what is often a hostile environment. In these stories we illustrate how practical justice provides an innovative way to approach issues to do with sexual and reproductive health, particularly as they relate to enhancing the lives of people in visible, grassroots ways. In this way, given evidence, good normative judgement and the opportunity to do good and be fair, practical justice may be seen to be taking place.

AB There is increasing recognition that the nutrition transition sweeping the world's cities is multifaceted. Urban food and nutrition systems are beginning to share similar features, including an increase in dietary diversity, a convergence toward "Western-style" diets rich in fat and refined carbohydrate and within-country bifurcation of food supplies and dietary conventions. Unequal access to the available dietary diversity, calories, and gastronomically satisfying eating experience leads to nutritional inequalities and diet-related health inequities in rich and poor cities alike. Understanding the determinants of inequalities in food security and nutritional quality is a precondition for developing preventive policy responses. Finding common solutions to under-and overnutrition is required, the first step of which is poverty eradication through creating livelihood strategies. In many cities, thousands of positions of paid employment could be created through the establishment of sustainable and self-sufficient local food systems, including urban agriculture and food processing initiatives, food distribution centers, healthy food market services, and urban planning that provides for multiple modes of transport to food outlets. Greater engagement with the food supply may dispel many of the food anxieties affluent consumers are experiencing.

   return on equity; Johannesburg Stock Exchange
ID BOARD STRUCTURE; SUSTAINABILITY; DIRECTORS; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT
AB There have been many corporate collapses and financial crises in recent years linked to a lack of effective corporate governance. The South African King IV Code of Corporate Governance recommends that corporate governing bodies should be comprised of an appropriate balance of knowledge, diversity, and independence for discharging their duties objectively and more efficiently. This study examines the effect of corporate governance structures on firm financial performance. The secondary data of selected Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index-listed mining firms' sustainability reports, and integrated annual financial statements are used. Using panel data analysis of the random effects model, we determined the relationship between board independence and board size and the return on equity (ROE) for the period 2010-2015. Results indicate a weak negative correlation between ROE and board size, and a weak, but positive, correlation between ROE and board independence. Additionally, there is a positive, but weak, correlation between ROE and sales growth, but a negative and weak relationship between ROE and firm size. The study suggests that effective corporate governance through a small effective board and monitoring by an independent board result in increased firm financial performance. We recommend that South African companies see compliance with the recommendations of the King IV Code on Corporate Governance not as a liability, but an ethical investment that may likely yield financial benefit in the long-term. Although complying with corporate governance principles does not necessarily translate into a significant economic benefit, firms should, however, continue to adopt corporate governance for ethical reasons to meet stakeholder's social and environmental needs for sustainable development.

DT Article
DE distance learning; inclusion; DARS; social network theory; digital
   equity; inclusive education
AB This article presents the results from an investigation that used a qualitative perspective of a descriptive type to identify the inclusive educational processes from 707 preschool and primary education schools in Colombia, distributed around 26 territorial units out of a total of 32. To obtain all this information around the country, a data collection strategy was applied, which we named the distributed access research strategy (DARS). All the data was collected by tertiary education students from two programs of the Faculty of Education, Corporacion Universitaria Iberoamericana in Colombia. The results revealed that most preschools and primary schools have documented institutional educational plans referencing diversity and inclusion for their students, but they have difficulties in establishing strategies to identify and implement curricular adaptations within their contexts, as well as with the use of tracking instruments. These results generated a reflection for reviewing the syllabus and study plans in the tertiary education programs at this university to better prepare future teachers who will face such scenarios in their locations across the country. Moreover, this new DARS datacollection strategy shows an interesting potential, which is generic enough to enable unlimited research topics to be explored within distance learning contexts.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   University researchers can leverage a data collection strategy based on the distributed students' social network connections.
   Preschools and primary schools should review their management indicators for inclusive practices.
   Universities with education faculties need to reflect on their syllabus and how it supports training future teachers to service diversity scenarios.
   In practice, DARS can be applied to further review how public policies are being applied in a distributed population across the country.

TI Consideration of ethnicity in guidelines and systematic reviews
   promoting lifestyle interventions: a thematic analysis
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English

ID MINORITY GROUPS; DISEASES; HEALTH; MIGRANT; EUROPE
AB Background: There is a growing body of evidence supporting lifestyle interventions for the prevention of chronic disease. However, it is unclear to what extent these evidence-derived recommendations are applicable to ethnic minority populations. We sought to assess the degree of consideration of ethnicity in systematic reviews and guidelines for lifestyle interventions. Methods: Two reviewers systematically searched seven databases to identify systematic reviews (n = 111) and UK evidence-based guidelines (n = 15) on smoking cessation, increasing physical activity and promoting healthy diet, which were then scrutinized for ethnicity-related considerations. Evidence statements were independently extracted and thematically analysed. Results: Forty-one of 111 (37%) systematic reviews and 12 of 15 (80%) guidelines provided an evidence statement relating to ethnicity; however, these were often cursory and focused mainly on the need for better evidence. Five major themes emerged: (i) acknowledging the importance of diversity and how risk factors vary by ethnicity; (ii) noting evidence gaps in the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions for ethnic minorities; (iii) observing differential effects of interventions where these have been trialled with ethnic minority populations; (iv) suggesting adaptation of interventions for ethnic minority groups; (v) proposing improvements in research on interventions involving ethnic minority populations. Conclusions: Despite increasing recognition of the challenges posed by ethnic health inequalities, there remains a lack of guidance on the extent to which generic recommendations are applicable to, and how best to promote lifestyle changes in, ethnic minority populations. These important evidence gaps need to be bridged and tools developed to ensure that equity and population context is appropriately considered within evidence syntheses.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of parents who have full professorial positions (in faculties of engineering and nursing) in universities in Ontario, Canada, with a particular focus on the ways in which gender shapes professors' parenting experiences. Design/methodology/approach We employ a case study methodology involving quantitative and qualitative data collected from a survey emailed to full professors in Ontario. Findings Data from the study reveal that numerous strategies, resources (e.g. informal social support networks, supportive partners) and institutional supports (i.e. pausing the tenure clock after child birth) are required to assist academics to meet the extensive demands of their positions, while they perform caregiving responsibilities for their children. Research limitations/implications The protected ground of family status is inconsistently applied in Canadian human rights policy, considerably reducing its transformative potential. Yet, while family status gains greater recognition in rights-based practice, we argue that it be added to forthcoming institutional equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) action plans across post-secondary institutions to better ensure equity for mothers who shoulder significant paid and unpaid work responsibilities. Originality/value While there is literature on parenting in academia, family status is rarely featured as an intersection of interest in EDI research. This article aims to fill this gap.

AB The American Geriatrics Society is committed to taking purposeful steps to address racism in health care, given its impact on older adults, their families, and our communities. In fall 2020, AGS added a statement to our vision for the future, which reflects that our commitment is central to mission: "We all are supported by and able to contribute to communities where ageism, ableism, classism, homophobia, racism, sexism, xenophobia, and other forms of bias and discrimination no longer impact healthcare access, quality, and outcomes for older adults and their caregivers." In 2021, we will be working to flesh out a multi-year, multi-pronged initiative that addresses the intersection of structural racism and ageism in health care. This will include engaging members in identifying strategies and with the goal of increasing member engagement around the idea that it will take all of us working together to achieve our vision for a collective future that is free of discrimination and bias. The Society has set as the first objective that by 2031, 100% of research presented at the AGS Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (JAGS) will reflect the diversity of the population being studied. Other immediate efforts include undertaking a complete update of the Geriatrics Cultural Navigator, development of corresponding public education materials, and a webinar series focused on helping us all understand our own implicit bias, recognize implicit and explicit bias, and consider actions that we each might take to address bias when we observe it.

TI DISCRIMINATION AS ANTI-ETHICAL: ACHIEVING SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN LARGE LAW

SO DENVER LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION; GENDER STEREOTYPES; LEGAL PROFESSION;
   LAWYERS; HEALTH; LIMITS; WOMEN; GAP
AB As protests calling for racial justice erupted across the country in 2020, many large law firms issued compelling statements acknowledging systemic inequities and bias. During the preceding few decades, firms had already expressed their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion; some had launched well-publicized diversity initiatives. Still, breakthrough progress has been elusive. Women, and especially women of color, continue to be severely underrepresented in partnership ranks. The gender pay gap at law firms persists. An unrelenting pattern of heavy burden in the lived experiences of women and women of color at law firms continues.
   This Article argues that an ethical reset is needed to drive true systemic change in large law firms. With the gender pay gap in law firm partnership compensation as a vehicle, this Article explains precisely how the design of the rules of professional conduct renders them largely symbolic on discrimination and ineffective against longstanding systemic barriers. It proposes a framework requiring (1) transparency of process and pay; (2) regular self-assessment addressing milestones; and (3) a financial incentive for compliance. The framework can be used as a springboard to address other consequences of systemic discrimination in law firms, like the abysmal underrepresentation of women of color. This Article takes leaders of large law firms at their word and extends an invitation to advocate for state supreme courts, state bars, the American Bar Association, and state legislatures to implement the proposed framework and finally bring about an ethical reset aimed squarely at eliminating systemic discrimination and bias in large law firms.

TI Framing Food Access: Do Community Gardens Inadvertently Reproduce
   Inequality?
SO HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
DE community gardens; content analysis; disparities; food access; race and

ID WHITENESS; FARM; IF
AB Background Alternative food programs have been proposed as solutions to food insecurity and diet-related health issues. However, some of the most popular programs-farmers markets and community-supported agriculture-overwhelmingly serve White and upper-middle-class individuals, exacerbating food security and health disparities. One explanation for the mismatch is the way in which alternative food programs are framed: Language used to encourage participation may reflect priorities of upper-middle-class and White populations who create and run these programs while lacking resonance with food-insecure populations. This literature, however, lacks consideration of how lower-cost, more participatory programs-community gardens-are framed. We therefore explore the framing of community gardens through a quantitative content analysis of the descriptions, missions, and goals provided by community garden managers across Minnesota (N= 411). Results Six frames were consistently present in the community garden statements: greater good, community orientation, healthy food access, food donation, self-empowerment, and symbolic food labels. Greater good and community orientation were significantly more likely to be used than any other frames. Conclusions Taken together, our findings suggest that community gardens may be welcoming toward a diversity of participants but still have room to improve the inclusivity of their frames. The common use of a community orientation suggests the unique ability of community gardens among alternative food programs to benefit Black, Latino, and working-class populations. However, the most common frame observed was "greater good," suggesting one mechanism through which community gardens, like other types of alternative food programs, may be reproducing inequality through alienation of food-insecure populations.

DE Civic engagement; local governance; small towns; housing planning;
   housing policy; social capital
AB Small towns possess many of the components needed for stakeholder-led governance models, including strong social ties, frequent interactions and social norms that support participation in civic life. This study seeks to better understand civic engagement with housing decision-making in rural small towns. We examine the diversity of actively engaged stakeholder groups and the ways in which stakeholder participation is related to community characteristics using survey responses from representatives of 164 small towns within one Southeastern state. For the small towns in our study, population size, limited administrative capacity and access to human capital resources were associated with fewer engaged stakeholder groups. Relatively few stakeholder groups were involved in housing decision-making on average and those experiencing the greatest disadvantage were likely not at the table. This research adds to the limited body of research on civic engagement by exploring stakeholder engagement in housing decisions and policies in small towns using a unique dataset. Our study highlights the ways in which the potential for civic engagement in small towns is hindered, limiting the capacity and equity of housing policy among rural communities that likely have an array of housing problems. Understanding how and why local governments in small towns engage stakeholder groups for housing planning and decision-making is an area for future research.

AB Current trends on urbanization and concerns on the frequency of natural disasters have promoted increased interest in the concept of City Resilience among Smart City scholars and other researchers in Urban Studies. Cities with strong resilience have a strong ability to adapt to disturbances. A key research issue involves the development of frameworks to better understand and measure the levels of resilience in a city. This article explores the dimensions and measurement of city resilience. Using the multiple-case study method, we identify main topics in the plans of three cities, comparing them to the main domain categories identified in the city resilience literature: social resilience, economic resilience, community capital, institutional resilience, infrastructure resilience and environmental resilience. Our findings suggest that infrastructure and institutional resilience are generally considered as the most popular indicator across the cities. Second, every dimension of resiliency includes several sub-dimensions in the resilience framework, but some sub-dimensions are not mentioned in the resilience plans of the three cities. Third, the practice of these cities shows that in social resilience, the decision-makers should pay more attention to education and equity, public health services and social services and well-being, then in economic resilience, we should emphasize economic diversity, employment and economic recovery. A revised resilient city measurement model is suggested in the end of the paper.

AB This study identifies factors that are significantly related to student intentions to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations by age 30, and examines how those factors differ across definitions of STEM occupation, educational attainment levels, and student demographics. Data from 2009 High School Longitudinal Study base year were used, and were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. Expectancy-value theory is the theoretical framework for this study. The findings from this study suggest that depending on the definition of STEM careers operationalized in the analysis, variation can be observed in the impact of gender, while the role of the expectancy-value constructs remains largely consistent across multiple definitions of STEM careers. The results also suggest that while expectancy-value constructs such as utility, interest, and attainment value are significantly related to the STEM career plans of White students, fewer significant relationships between expectancy-value constructs and the STEM career plans of Black and Hispanic students were identified. Additionally, findings from this study raise questions about the extent to which STEM career choices at the sub-bachelor's degree level can be understood as achievement-related choices, and thus the extent to which expectancy-value theory is a suitable framework for understanding those choices.

In this text, a contour is made in the indicatives of quality education in the documents disseminated by UNESCO (World Declaration on Education for All: meeting basic learning needs; the Dakar Framework for Action - Education for All: Taking on board our commitments Incheon Declaration and Framework for Action: Towards Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education and Lifelong Education for All) and those specific to the Brazilian scenario (National Human Rights Education Plan, National Guideline Education in Human Rights, National Curricular Guidelines for Basic Education and the National Education Plan 2014-2024), analyzing the consequences of these indicatives for school management, the documents were analyzed through the Content Analysis Technique. Among the challenges facing school management for the provision of quality education, the following stand out: Democratic management, the development of a human rights culture; the structuring of safe and healthy learning environments; the existence of a political-pedagogical project based on humanistic values; the articulation between educating and caring; a pedagogical practice based on the principles of freedom, equality, equity and diversity; the development of skills; the promotion of learning; the evaluation of educational quality; academic formation, professional qualification and enhancement of education professionals.

   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study assessed a crowdsourcing open call offered from June 16 to July 16, 2020, that sought ideas to inform safety in the fall 2020 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). Digital methods (email and social media) were used for promotion, and submissions were collected online for 4 weeks. Participation was open to UNC students, staff, faculty, and others.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Submissions were evaluated for innovation, feasibility, inclusivity, and potential to improve safety and well-being. Demographic data were collected from submitting individuals, and submissions were qualitatively analyzed for emergent themes on challenges with and solutions for addressing safety and well-being in the fall semester. Data were shared with UNC leadership to inform decision-making.
   RESULTS The open call received 82 submissions from 110 participants, including current UNC students (56 submissions [68%]), people younger than 30 years (67 [82%]), women (55 [67%]), and individuals identifying as a racial/ethnic minority or as multiracial/ethnic (49 [60%]). Seven submissions were identified as finalists and received cash prizes with the encouragement to use these funds toward idea development and implementation. Seventeen runner-up teams were linked to university resources for further development. Thematic analysis of submissions regarding challenges with the fall semester revealed not only physical health concerns and the limitations of remote learning but also challenges that have been exacerbated by the pandemic, such as a lack of mental health support, structural racism and inequality, and insufficient public transportation. Solutions included novel ideas to support mental health among specific populations (eg, graduate students and racial/ethnic minorities), improve health equity, and increase transit access. All 24 finalists and runners-up indicated interest in implementation after being notified of the open call results.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that open calls are a feasible strategy for university community engagement on COVID-19, providing a stakeholder-driven approach to identifying promising ideas for enhancing safety and well-being. Open calls could be formally incorporated into university planning processes to develop COVID-19 safety strategies that are responsive to diverse community members' concerns.

AB Objective: Community-engaged research (CEnR) is an approach to inquiry that centers scientist-community partnerships characterized by mutuality and reciprocity, and is well-aligned with trauma-informed principles, such as trustworthiness, transparency, and fostering empowerment. Method: The current paper considers definitions and applications of CEnR, highlighting examples from the trauma literature, from the formulation of research questions to the dissemination of research findings. Conclusion: To realize CEnR's promise to contribute to innovation, scientific understanding, and increased impact in the trauma field will require a shift in training and institutions. Fortunately, a growing interest in advocacy, public psychology, and diversity, equity, and inclusion presents an opportunity for synergy. Practical guidance is offered for supporting CEnR by preparing students, investing in faculty, and building infrastructure.
   Clinical Impact Statement Community-engaged research (CEnR) focuses on equitable scientist-community partnerships in research, and shares principles with trauma-informed work. By prioritizing community collaboration, CEnR has the potential to lead to innovation, scientific understanding, and increased impact in the trauma field. For example, CEnR approaches emphasize dissemination to public audiences, which could help educate the public and policymakers about trauma and its impact.

AB Structural racism in the United States underlies racial disparities in the criminal justice system, in the healthcare system generally, and with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the year 2020, these inequities combined and magnified to such a degree that it left Black Americans and physicians caring for them questioning how much Black lives matter. Academic medical centers and the major cardiology organizations responded to a global call to end racism with bold statements and initiatives. Interventional cardiologists utilize advanced equipment to mechanically treat a wide spectrum of heart problems, yet this technology has not been applied in an equitable manner. Interventional therapies are often underutilized in Blacks, exacerbating healthcare disparities and contributing to the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these communities. Racial bias, whether intentional, unconscious, systemic, or at the individual level, plays a role in these disparities. Many in the interventional cardiology community aspire to take intentional steps to reduce the impact of bias and racism in our specialty. We discuss several proposals here and provide a "report card" for interventional programs to perform a self-assessment.

AB Urban forests are increasingly acknowledged as sources of multiple benefits and central to climate resilience and human well-being. Given these diverse and significant benefits, it is important to govern urban forests so as to ensure that all residents have equitable access and enjoyment. Understanding urban forest preferences, and including them in planning and management, is a key aspect of informed and contextually relevant urban forest governance. Although many studies have examined public urban forest preferences, we lack an understanding of the preferences of a key stakeholder: urban foresters. This study presents the results of semi-structured interviews with 22 urban forestry and allied green practitioners focused on preferred and least-preferred aspects of the urban forest. Participants expressed their preferred urban forest characteristics according to four themes: administration, spatial attributes, naturalness, and social benefits. Least-preferred characteristics were expressed under the themes of administration and degradation. Results suggest that practitioners employ a systems-level lens when discussing urban forest preferences. However, they also draw on personal experience when constructing their preferences, particularly in relation to naturalness and spatial diversity. These results provide insight into the urban forest preferences of practitioners and highlight the importance of innovative approaches, such as mosaic governance in urban forestry, to facilitate a just integration of the diverse preferences of urban forest stakeholders.

AB Across the globe, continued policy debates regarding the management of old-growth forests center around the difficult task of balancing economic and ecological considerations. Though the forests of the Pacific Northwest United States are among the most studied old-growth ecosystems, ecological and economic analyses have yielded public land management directives that remain controversial. Specifically, the recently adopted Northwest Forest Plan lacks explicit goals for maintaining intergenerational equity for the use of forest resources and the diversity of old-growth ecosystems. Unlike previous studies which rely on monetary quantification of costs and benefits, this study develops and applies a conceptual framework for evaluating socially optimal Pacific Northwest old-growth forest utilization strategies. Conditions for the optimal management of old-growth forests are derived using dynamic programming. The objective function synthesizes relevant biological and economic attributes of the old-growth allocation problem. Results in the form of extraction paths are compared given social pressure for consumptive and non-consumptive benefits, as well as different planning horizons, rates of social time preference, and environmental variance. Lengthening the planning horizon results in a vast divergence of optimal policies in the absence of discounting. Extraction rates appear to approach zero as the planning horizon approaches infinity. While higher rates of social time preference increase the rate of extraction, forest stocks remaining at the terminal time period equal levels remaining with a lower discount rate. Increasing environmental variance results in a higher level of stock remaining at the terminal time period. This analysis, while specific to the old-growth controversy of the Pacific Northwest, does provide general guidelines for addressing similar problems of multiple uses of natural areas, particularly where such uses are mutually incompatible, or where one use may be irreversibly destructive to another.

AB To support equitable planning, model-based analyses can be used to explore inequality patterns arising from different scenarios. Scenario discovery is increasingly used to extract insights from ensembles of simulation. Here, we apply two scenario discovery approaches for unraveling inequality patterns and their drivers, with an application to spatial inequality of farms profitability in the Vietnam Mekong Delta. First, we follow an established sequential approach where we begin with clustering the inequality patterns from the simulation results and next identify model input subspaces that best explain each cluster. Second, we propose a novel concurrent approach using Multivariate Regression Trees to simultaneously classify inequality patterns and identify their corresponding input subspaces. Both approaches have comparable output space separability performance. The concurrent approach yields significantly better input space separability, but this comes at the expense of having a larger number of subspaces, requiring analysts to make extra effort to distill policy-relevant insights.

AB This article seeks to analyze the experience of collective construction of portfolios as a teaching-learning method in the discipline of Health Policy, identifying the competencies developed by students. Qualitative research, whose collection and data processing were conducted by means of documental and thematic analysis of 34 portfolios. The "Learning to be" and "Learning to live and work together" competencies were considered according to the proposals of the UNESCO report for Education. The training of critical-reflexive individuals, provided by the portfolio, was particularly observed when students reported the transformation of the negative views that they had about the health care system - an inefficient and precarious policy - to a positive vision - policy which deals with the principles of equity, integrity and universality. This process of critical transformation is the result of the practice and use of communication skills, information management (search, selection, analysis and evaluation of information), leadership, cooperation and human relationships (teamwork, ethics and recognition of diversity), and personal competencies (time management, responsibility and planning), namely important skills in the training of professionals committed to the national health policy.

AB Work in urban resilience planning recognizes the importance of knowledge diversity to understanding and acting on climate change, but falls short in adequately situating itself within ongoing historical processes that shape uneven urban playing fields in which planning happens. This paper uses insights from environmental feminist and decolonial knowledge politics to challenge knowledge systems analysis to explicitly question and alter structures of power in environmental knowledge making in North American cities. If knowledge systems analysis can investigate and intervene in governance structures through which environmental decision- and policy-making happen, this necessitates reflection on ontological, epistemological and ethical commitments (or `starting points') as these carry material and discursive weight: they open up and foreclose ways in which resilience is practiced. Given increasing recognition that urban resilience needs to consider issues of justice and equity, in this paper we take cues from feminist and decolonial scholarship that has centered these themes for decades and which offer 'starting points' to rethink knowledge systems for resilience. Understanding urbanization as key process in the expansion of relations fundamental to the production of anthropocentric climate change, we argue that changing these relations is crucial if urban resilience planning is to contribute to alternative and socially just urban futures. Against tendencies of depoliticization that solutions-oriented work can sometimes exhibit, feminist and decolonial perspectives locate knowledge-making practices squarely within struggles for social justice in the city. We propose three strategies for those working on knowledge systems for resilience to advance their practice: centering justice and transgression, reflexive research practice, and thinking historically. Ultimately, this paper shows that taking seriously critical social sciences furthers fundamentally new ideas for what transitions to urban resilience could mean.

AB Preference for private, motorised transportation grew substantially throughout the global North, during the 20th Century. Through this time rates of licencing, and car ownership, and vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) rose across age groups. This had a range of environmental and social equity implications, and ignited a priority for investment in road infrastructure. The system of automobility was cemented by lock-in through the assemblage of infrastructure, technologies, policies and behaviours supporting, and frequently requiring, car based mobility. Yet recent evidence has shown that generation Y (18-35 year olds) are practicing mobility in different ways to earlier generations. Stabilising and declining rates of VKT, licencing and vehicle ownership have been identified in a range of industrialised countries. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this paper draws from theories of social practice and the theory of planned behaviour, as two traditions to examine what people 'do', focusing on the social and the individual respectively. It examines the motivations to learn to drive (LTD), and the preference for driving in New Zealand, a highly car dependent country, empirically drawing from 51 qualitative interviews. A series of meta-themes are presented and used to explain intended and actual behaviour relating to driving practices. The empirical research finds a diversity of highly nuanced interpretations of LTD, some of which reflect individual characteristics, whilst other interpretations are best understood grounded in a wider societal reading of contemporary trends and meanings. Frequently, justification for learning to drive goes beyond the competency and capacity to drive independently. Implications for policy and planning are detailed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The term resilience' is increasingly used in the context of discussion, policies and programming around climate change adaptation1 (adaptation') and disaster risk reduction2. It has become particularly popular to describe the intersection between these two fields and those of poverty and development, and climate resilient development' is rapidly becoming a catch-all for tackling climate change impacts in a development context. This paper reviews academic use of the concept of resilience' in social, ecological and socio-ecological systems and its application to the climate, disaster and development nexus. From this review, we distil 10 key characteristics of resilience: high diversity; effective governance and institutions; the ability to work with uncertainty and change; community involvement and the inclusion of local knowledge; preparedness and planning for disturbances; high social and economic equity; robust social values and structures, acknowledging non-equilibrium dynamics, continual and effective learning and the adoption of a cross-scalar perspective. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps and suggest directions for further research.

ID HIGHER-EDUCATION; TRANSFORMATION
AB Orientation: This article explores employees' subjective experiences of employment equity (EE) within South African organisational contexts, adding diverse and in-depth insights to the post-apartheid EE discourse.
   Research purpose: The purpose is to hear the voices of employees of different social-cultural, racial and gender backgrounds on the experiences of EE in contemporary South African organisations.
   Motivation for the study: Research suggests that South African organisations are pressurised to redress past racial inequality. Understanding employees' subjective experiences of EE adds value to the debate and provides the reader with an in-depth contemporary image of EE in post-apartheid South African organisations.
   Research approach/design and method: A hermeneutic phenomenological approach, within the qualitative interpretive paradigm, yielded in-depth, rich and detailed descriptions of employees' experiences of EE in both the private and public sectors of the South African workplace.
   Main findings: Findings show five themes that are associated with experiences of EE within South African organisations. This study highlights differences of experiences regarding EE plans and processes based on racial background, gender and age, as well as on historical socio-cultural and racial classifications of being a member of advantaged and disadvantaged groups. The following findings are highlighted: the insight into the experiences of EE from the perspectives of the 'born-frees' (the differences in experiences of different age groups of employees) and the experienced discrimination of black male and female employees regarding race and the experiences of gender-based discrimination being described by black and white male employees.
   Practical/managerial implications: Findings show the focus of experiences of EE, the conflicting issues and what South African organisations need to focus on in terms of human resources management (HRM) and the development of employee relations across racial and gender divides. It shows which topics need to be addressed in employee development and training programmes to manage diversity constructively and effectively.
   Contribution/value-add: The findings can be used by human resources managers to: (1) monitor the progress towards EE competently and vigorously, (2) create awareness and communication within individuals, organisations and society regarding EE, (3) create best practices in order to benefit from EE (members of all racial, gender, cultural groups), (4) create a discourse on humanistic and reflexive HRM, and(5) implement consulting, training and development programmes in organisations that are strategically, sustainably and long-term orientated.

TI Paradox of meritocracy in surgical selection, and of variation in the
   attractiveness of individual specialties: to what extent are women still
   disadvantaged?
SO ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE diversity; gender bias; meritocracy; selection; women in surgery
AB Background Evidence from outside surgery suggests that meritocracy-based processes around selection tend to reduce, rather than increase, diversity. In recent years, the surgical training boards have gone to considerable effort to achieve greater transparency and fairness in their selection processes, and to identify those attributes that are believed to best predict future success as a surgeon. This is consistent with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Diversity and Inclusion Plan, which places emphasis on gender equity and has goals that include increasing the attractiveness of surgery as a vocation for women, removing impediments to them applying to the surgical training programmes and removing any biases that might disadvantage them during the selection process. Methods This study uses the Female Opportunity Index and rate ratio metrics to measure the level of female disadvantage in surgical selection, whether it be by the perception of its attractiveness to women which influences their application rates, or by the likelihood of successful selection for those who have applied, compared with their male counterparts. Results There are marked differences between the nine surgical specialties and 13 specialty training boards in both the proportion of women who apply, and the proportion who are successful in gaining entry onto the Surgical Education and Training programmes. The Female Opportunity Index ranged from 0.21 to 0.87, which represents a wide variation between surgical specialties. Conclusion These data raise the question as to whether unconscious bias is occurring in an apparently meritocracy-based selection process in some specialties. The data also suggest that some specialties are relatively unattractive to women, for which the reasons are likely to be complex.

DT Article; Early Access
DE ethnic-racial identity; measurement; adolescence
ID IDENTITY RESEARCH; RACIAL IDENTITY; SAMPLE-SIZE; RACE; ISSUES
AB Objective: In nationally funded research in the U.S., ethnicity and race are measured with checkbox questions, the limited categories of which may yield significant missing data and low salience to available categories, particularly among adults of color. How adolescent-generated data compare to these limited categories, and how adolescents, not just those of color, describe their culture are understudied. In our sample, we asked the following: (a) how do adolescents' ethnicity/race and culture identifications compare?, (b) how do adolescents' open-ended ethnicity/race and checkbox ethnicity/race labels compare?, and (c) how do adolescents' ethnicity/race labels compare to available categories for identification on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) demographic form? Method: Data from 76 adolescents (64.5% female, M (age) = 15.78 years) were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results: White adolescents were as likely as adolescents of color to identify with cultural labels, and most adolescents described culture differently than race/ethnicity. White adolescents' open-ended and checkbox labels overlapped more (38.8%) than adolescents of colors' (22.5%). Only 17% of adolescents' open-ended race/ethnicity identification labels and 54% of their checkbox identifications were available on the NIH's demographic form. Conclusions: As measurement of demographic data is reduced to few options that favor privileged identities, innovative methods to measure individuals' identities are warranted. Using tools that do not reflect individuals' identity labels may increase error and reflects structural problems of research inequity. Our findings provide initial evidence of this methodological issue in a sample of adolescents. Building inclusive demographic tools from individuals' self-descriptors that remain feasible and practical for use can diminish inequity associated with describing "diverse" populations.
   Public Significance Statement This study provided support for measuring culture and expanding ethnicity/race reporting categories using individuals' own labels in a sample of ethnic/racially diverse adolescents. As limited-category ethnicity/race measurement forms favor privileged identities, we provide support for adapting them to be more inclusive and valid in representing an increasingly diversifying population.

AB Collaborative Spatial Decision Making (CSDM) is the process of groups of decision makers and interested parties using Geographic Information Analysis tools and Group Decision Support tools to generate or negotiate better solutions to public problems. While there are many applications of spatial modeling and GIS in the public decision making process, there are few applications focusing on cooperative problem formulation where models generate solutions that are both optimal and politically feasible. A group may create a feasible model by cooperatively agreeing on a list of objectives, decision variables, constraints, and weighting factors.
   This paper will demonstrate the conception of a collaborative problem formulation and alternative generation system for the School District Planning Problem (SDPP). A group working on the SDPP seeks to create a long-term student enrollment management plan for a school district. Major interest groups include the students, parents, neighbors, teachers, staff, administrators, and Board Members (decision makers and political actors). Major obstacles include changing demographics, limited funds, Limited space, existing rules and regulations, political considerations and mandates, and interest group activism. Some general (and conflicting) goals include maximizing education quality, student safety, neighborhood stability, equity, and diversity, while minimizing costs. We propose a GIS and modeling tool where groups may select the objectives and constraints to develop feasible solutions specific to their own school district's needs. The group can specify boundary conditions, site capacities and locations, student travel time and distance constraints, etc., to generate modeled alternatives which may be evaluated and adjusted to feasible options.

AB The field of language planning and policy (LPP) provides a rich array of research opportunities for applied linguists and social scientists. However, as a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand, among other things, why some languages thrive whereas others are marginalized, LPP may appear quite theoretical and far removed from the lives of many English language teaching (ELT) practitioners. This is unfortunate, because ELT professionals-be they teachers, program developers, materials and textbook writers, administrators, consultants, or academics-are involved in one way or another in the processes of LPP. The purpose of this article is to unravel those processes and the role of ELT professionals in them for both theoretical and practical reasons: theoretical, because we believe there are principled ways to account for why particular events affect the status and vibrancy of languages and speech communities, and practical, because we believe there are ways to influence the outcome of social processes. In general, we find that the principle of linguistic self-determinism-the right to choose (within limits) what languages one will use and be educated in-is not only viable but desirable for LPP decision making because it both promotes social equity and fosters diversity. In this article, we examine how ELT professionals are already actively engaged in deciding language policies, how they promote policies reaffirming or opposing hierarchies of power that reflect entrenched historical and institutional beliefs (see Phillipson & Skutnabb-Kangas, this issue), and how they might affect changes in their local contexts.

AB Urban areas are constantly changing due to the pressures of migration and rapid growth in urban populations. As a result, historically and culturally significant sites are under increased risk of deterioration and this affects the urban sustainability transitions culturally and socially. Thus, an operationally multidimensional conservation management framework is needed with new approaches to historic heritage sites, in which urban dynamics are considered extensively. Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) concept, which was launched by UNESCO in 2011 brought a new comprehensive perspective with parameters to help protect heritage areas in more sustainable ways. The parameters of HUL consists of aspects such as but not limited to landscape, culture, stakeholders, diversity, sustainability, multidisciplinary cooperation, equity, participation, and building capacity. This new approach was developed for relatively more sustainable and integrated ways to protect heritage in the urban context. It is also a management tool to support the Site Management Plans more holistically in the conservation of historic and cultural heritage sites within the World Heritage List. In this research, Kyrenia Historic Port Area was studied with respect to the aspects elaborated in the Historic Urban Landscape approach of UNESCO. A sustainable and participatory conservation process was found to be lacking due to the institutional, economic and political challenges. In that context, a relatively more inclusive and participatory model was proposed, which can be incorporated in Management Plans. In order to test the applicability of the concept of the Historic Urban Landscape in the stated area; internationally applied field management plans, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) laws, provisions, and ordinances have been examined through the review of the relevant literature. Additionally in the context of heritage site protection, the purpose, definition, processes, and components of the Site Management Plans were discussed. In regard to the proposed model, The Australian Ballarat Site Management Plan as conceptual framework was examined and subsequently the methods and management mechanisms were analyzed. In result of the analyses, a proposed innovative model was discussed in order to determine the flow of the management system of Kyrenia in the historic port area and to ensure the participation of stakeholders in the decision-making as well as the conservation of the area, which are essential elements in establishing more sustainable conservation and management of heritage sites not only in the city of Kyrenia but also in other parts of the country and the Island as a whole.

AB Community Sports Parks are an innovative practice in Zhuhai City, China for resolving the poor-quality living environment and insufficient sports and leisure space due to the rapid development of the city. However, there are few studies on the impact of Community Sports Parks on the well-being of surrounding residents. Therefore, this study involved the following: field research in 28 communities, questionnaire surveys on the use of Community Sports Parks and residents' subjective well-being, and a multiple regression model to analyse the relationship between subjective well-being and Community Sports Parks. The results indicate the following: (1) Community Sports Parks have positive effects on residents' subjective well-being; (2) The diversity and accessibility of Community Sports Parks have positive effects on residents' subjective well-being; (3) Age plays a positive role in regulating the diversity of facilities in Community Sports Parks and residents' subjective wellbeing. Therefore, during construction, Community Sports Parks should incorporate numerous park facilities to increase their versatility. To ensure social equality, we should plan the construction of Community Sports Parks in terms of convenience, accessibility, and spatial distribution, instead of excessively pursuing large-scale construction. Simultaneously, independent age group requirements should be considered during construction to meet the sports and leisure needs of different age groups, especially the elderly.

TI Steps to improve gender diversity in coastal geoscience and engineering
SO PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID WOMEN
AB Robust data are the base of effective gender diversity policy. Evidence shows that gender inequality is still pervasive in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Coastal geoscience and engineering (CGE) encompasses professionals working on coastal processes, integrating expertise across physics, geomorphology, engineering, planning and management. The article presents novel results of gender inequality and experiences of gender bias in CGE, and proposes practical steps to address it. It analyses the gender representation in 9 societies, 25 journals, and 10 conferences in CGE and establishes that women represent 30% of the international CGE community, yet there is underrepresentation in prestige roles such as journal editorial board members (15% women) and conference organisers (18% women). The data show that female underrepresentation is less prominent when the path to prestige roles is clearly outlined and candidates can selfnominate or volunteer instead of the traditional invitation-only pathway. By analysing the views of 314 survey respondents (34% male, 65% female, and 1% "other''), we show that 81% perceive the lack of female role models as a key hurdle for gender equity, and a significantly larger proportion of females (47%) felt held back in their careers due to their gender in comparison with males (9%). The lack of women in prestige roles and senior positions contributes to 81% of survey respondents perceiving the lack of female role models in CGE as a key hurdle for gender equality. While it is clear that having more women as role models is important, this is not enough to effect change. Here seven practical steps towards achieving gender equity in CGE are presented: (1) Advocate for more women in prestige roles; (2) Promote high-achieving females; (3) Create awareness of gender bias; (4) Speak up; (5) Get better support for return to work; (6) Redefine success; and, (7) Encourage more women to enter the discipline at a young age. Some of these steps can be successfully implemented immediately (steps 1-4), while others need institutional engagement and represent major societal overhauls.

TI The Politics of Diversity: Integration in an Era of Political and Legal
   Uncertainty
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID DESEGREGATION; SEGREGATION; SCHOOLS; POLICY; BROWN
AB Background: The demographic landscape in the United States has shifted dramatically since Brown v. Board of Education, leading to more complex diversity in many school districts than the diversity contemplated nearly 60 years ago. Desegregation research has shown that countywide districts are better able to maintain diverse schools, have less White flight where enclaves do not exist, and maintain political support for high-quality, equitable schools in ways very different from the politics that exist in metropolitan areas in which city schools are separate from neighboring suburbs. While demographic diversity may provide an advantage in accomplishing integration (or allow for the possibility), as court oversight for desegregation fades, it is unclear whether the advantage of countywide districts will persist if this diversity results in more political opposition to pursuing voluntary integration.
   Purpose: This article explores the diversity policies and politics of two countywide school districts in the South experiencing enclave growth at a time of legal and political ambiguity: Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) and the Wake County Public Schools System (WCPSS). Both districts' voluntary desegregation efforts have been highly publicized as they are increasingly being affected by changing demographics and local politics. In this article, we seek to analyze how demographic change influences public support for and implementation of the districts' diversity policies. We also examine how political debates around diversity have shifted in response to the changing legal context and enclave formation in both districts.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection in our two case study sites focuses on similar variables in each. As this article focuses on our initial investigation of the two school districts, laying the groundwork for our future empirical research, our analysis is primarily based on data collected from each school district's website describing the diversity policies, demographic data trends within the district and community, as well as information on school board representation. We also used publicly available data from local, state, and federal data sources, including the American Community Survey and the 2010 Census, media articles from local newspapers (The Courier-Journal in Louisville and The News & Observer in Raleigh), legal documents such as court filings, and policy documents from the district. Through the document analysis, at each site we examined: (1) activities by district or community leaders to promote policies aimed at maintaining diversity; (2) any legal action and/or response affecting diversity policies, particularly the development of new suburban enclaves; and (3) past, present, and projected effects of diversity policies.
   Conclusions: Whether JCPS and WCPSS are able to achieve diversity in a time of political and legal uncertainty has yet to be determined. As demographics change, enclave schools and communities increase, politics and policymaking become more and more influenced by politically savvy parents, and the future of diversity plans remains uncertain. However, the case for and benefits of integration may be clearer than ever. The question that remains is, to what depths are school districts willing to go to establish and maintain diverse environments that are key to achieving equity of opportunity for all students.

AB Guided by sociological perspectives that view (young) children as agents who are shaped by and shape the structures of social systems in which they live, we studied forms that agency of young children from historically marginalized groups may take in science class when offered opportunities to engage in science in a variety of ways, how curricular and instructional structures facilitate or hinder these children's agency, and how their agency influence these structures. Using a case study approach, we analyzed performance and narrative data related to Carlos, a Latino 3rd grader, to understand the dialectical relationship between Carlos's agency and structural elements of his year-long science class as a sociocultural system populated with people, curricular and instructional structures, research structures, artifacts, and tools. Carlos performed and narrated his self in relation to science differently across the various structures in which he found himself-as a knowledge broker, a (self-appointed) authority, an emergent author, and a self-identified scientist. His agency was linked to the roles he performed within the structures, roles he created at the intersection of the rules and resources that governed the structures in which he was immersed, and of his construction and interpretation of them. Learning from Carlos's case, we discuss implications for teachers of science to recognize the many ways in which students make meaning and plan for them, and to craft ideologies that embrace and nurture student agency in relation to structuresan essential understanding that should inform teaching and teacher education for justice and equity.

AB This paper investigates the ability of female presence to affect value relevance. Focusing on a sample of 487 entities listed in 18 European countries over the period 2009-2017, it uses a price model to assess the ability of female presence to affect the value relevance of earnings and book value disclosed in the consolidated annual reports of the firms analyzed. Findings offer evidence that female presence on corporate boards increases the value relevance of accounting amounts, providing insights that board composition affects investors' judgments. Taking into account that in the literature scholars have shown that female presence is associated with market prices, this paper provides a contribution, showing its ability to affect the value relevance of earnings and book value of equity. The research findings suggest that not only the quality of accounting standards but also other factors such as female presence on the corporate board of directors affect accounting practices and, in turn, the quality of financial reporting and value relevance. Its findings offer an additional support to the European Union Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 according to which an increase in women's participation in the labor market has a strong, positive impact on the whole economy.

AB Issue addressed Children of Maori & Pacific Islander descent living in Australia have a greater prevalence of overweight/obesity and an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. This study aimed to co-design Healthier Together, a community-based, childhood overweight/obesity prevention program tailored to Maori & Pacific Islander cultures.
   Methods Co-design involved a three-phase, iterative, participatory and experience-based process, guided by the Te Ara Tika: Guidelines for Maori Research Ethics to promote respect and equity. Following traditional oratory customs of Maori & Pacific Islander cultures, "talanoa" facilitated the collaborative program design with recruited Maori & Pacific Islander consumers, cultural advisors and health professionals. Co-design formulated program objectives, session plans, resources and evaluation tools.
   Results Co-design developed a 9-week community-based childhood overweight/obesity prevention program providing culturally tailored education across four themes: (a) nutrition (b) physical activity (c) positive parenting practices (d) culture and health. Strong community engagement developed a program highly tailored to the local Maori & Pacific Islander population.
   Conclusions Co-design methodology promotes equity and inclusion of all stakeholders, acknowledges and caters to diversity and creates a medium for openness, respect and shared purpose. Community-led participatory approaches are pivotal to engaging and empowering communities to successfully improve health behaviours, particularly in tackling childhood overweight/obesity.
   So what? Healthier Together is culturally significant to ensure relevance, effectiveness and sustainability. It is relevant and potentially adaptable to other priority populations across Australia and globally. Ultimately, the delivery of culturally tailored health care will contribute to a reduction in the health inequity experienced amongst priority populations.

AB Urban forestry and arboriculture are male-dominated industries. Although women have experienced current and historical marginalization in these industries, recent years have seen more young women embrace opportunities and pursue careers in these fields. In order to understand and enhance women's participation in urban forestry and arboriculture, this research assesses the current status of women's participation in these industries, barriers they have experienced, and strategies used to overcome these barriers and promote women's leadership. A total of 515 women working in urban forestry or arboriculture in Canada and the United States completed an online survey consisting of Likert-type, multiple-selection, and open-ended questions. Sixty percent of respondents reported unequal workplace treatment by gender, 74% had experienced sexist behaviour or harassment, and 84% had experienced workplace barriers that were gender-based. The frequency of inequitable experiences varied according to socio-demographic factors. Discrimination was the most commonly-experienced barrier, followed by family responsibilities, promotion bias, and the gender pay gap. Open-ended responses, which provided additional context, also varied according to socio-demographics. The top five strategies suggested to promote women's leadership were sponsorship/mentoring, confidence, communication, work-life balance, and career planning, with suggestions varying by barrier experienced. This research presents much-needed initial insights into women's experiences in urban forestry and arboriculture, with a focus on barriers to equity and strategies to overcome them. It is intended to begin a larger conversation on gender-based equity in these fields and points to areas for future research.

AB This paper attempts to reframe debates on the equity implications of spatial, socioeconomic, and political change in global cities in developing countries through a review of recent literature on this topic. It begins by critiquing the view that global cities in developing countries are converging around a model of development similar to that of the prototypical global cities of the United States, Europe, and Japan. It argues that three emerging perspectives hold the key to an analysis that better accounts for local agency and divergent outcomes in such cities: a focus on the diversity of cities' experience with globalization; recognition of the inherently negotiated nature of global impacts on urban outcomes; and a focus on actor-centered perspectives in urban analysis. The combined influence of these ideas amounts to a shift from a focus on global city 'models' to an examination of the interaction between global and local actors and institutions in a particular setting. Building on this literature review, the paper suggests an alternate framework for analyzing the link between global city development and inequality that focuses on three processes of change: the formation of public-private partnerships in urban governance, the spatial implications of the privatization of planning, and the flexiblization of labor. It argues that a focus on these processes has important implications for both theory and practice, as it allows us to understand similarity and difference in urban development, and more importantly, to understand the actors, institutions and interests that are driving change.

Motivated by the Erasmus+ EU project, Improving Higher Education Quality in Jordan using Mobile Technologies for Better Integration of Disadvantaged Groups to Socio-Economic Diversity (mEquity) (This paper is part of mEquity ERASMUS+ PROGRAMME, Project No : 561527-EPP-1-2015-1-BG-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.). A target group of students with physical and/or socio-economic disabilities has been selected to improve their learning skills. Surveys conducted among teachers and students at the planning phase have shown great interest towards creating such a platform for laboratories. Interestingly, the lab being developed covers experiments taught at the Communication Engineering Lab in PSUT which are not based on available online solutions. Moreover, a statistical assessment for the impact of the pilot experiments in the designed lab on the learning process was conducted using a pre and post questionnaires. The assessment has shown significant improvement after students got acquainted with the provided system.

In this essay, we situate Journal of Ethnobiology (JoE) in the discourse of ethical publishing, broadly, and in ethnobiology, specifically. We consider it an ethical imperative of JoE to promote the core values of the field of ethnobiology as a platform for scholarship that is both rigorous and socially just. We discuss here the many ways JoE addresses this imperative, including issues of diversity, accessibility, transparency, and how these efforts contribute to our ongoing relevance. We find that JoE has achieved high ethical standards and continues to raise the bar in our field. However, the growing incongruity between monetary solvency and best practices could threaten JoE's longevity unless we keep adapting to the changing landscape. Looking to the future, we encourage all ethnobiologists to participate in the ongoing process of improving ethics in publishing, including careful consideration of where to publish precious ethnobiological knowledge.

AB This paper presents the Evolvability Analysis Framework (EAF), a new perspective on evaluating complex infrastructure systems. EAF enables decision makers to explore alternative transition paths, thus providing several multi-step options to achieve a desired end state. These multi-step transition paths can be particularly valuable when they mitigate the impact of system degradation during the deployment of new capabilities. Additionally, EAF is formulated in a manner that empowers decision makers to apply decision variables, such as a cost cap or an equity metric, which are increasingly relevant to modern decision-making. To demonstrate the method and its value, we apply the EAF to a case study inspired by Los Angeles' Vision 2028. We identify 26 transition paths across different performance dimensions. We model the cost and performance of each transition pathway and compare them using multiple measures, including traditional benefit-cost metrics and differential impacts on different stakeholder groups. Our results show that multi-step paths outperform single-step transitions to an end state ("big bang" approaches) in most scenarios. Multi-step paths also provide valuable alternatives when particular stakeholders value non-cost metrics.

AB Objective: Morehouse School of Medicine, a collaborative partner in the National Research Mentoring Network, established the Mentoring Academy Institutional Planning Forum (MA Forum) to help minority-serving institutions (MSI) optimize research mentoring. In this commentary, we describe the policy workshop and review survey data from six MS's to assess the current state of organizational policies and activities that advance research mentoring.
   Participants: Twenty-eight institutional leaders, representing six MSIs, participated in an MA Forum between May 20, 2016 and May 11, 2017.
   Methods: After describing the MA Forum's background, design and recruitment strategy, we present a synthesis of institutional summaries built from responses to a 45-item survey that explored existing mentoring infrastructure, policies, and activities at each institution.
   Results: There is a heavy reliance on extramural funds to facilitate research mentoring initiatives. Mentoring policies and activities were most often governed by individual programs rather than the institution. Thus, the research mentoring expertise was concentrated at the local level, which may prevent opportunities for future scalability and optimization.
   Conclusions: Given these findings, we offer recommendations to help MSIs establish a mentoring culture backed by institutional policy.

DE Widening Access and Participation; learner analytics; learning gain and
   data informed decision-making
AB UK universities gather robust data on the Widening Access and Participation (WAP) profile of their students. This data is reported in statutory returns to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), in Access Agreements and in the Teaching Excellence Framework returns. Learner analytics can be a powerful driver of embedding WAP in institutional strategies and for setting and monitoring distributed key performance indicators (KPIs).
   This paper illustrates the development of comprehensive WAP Analytics that drives policy and practice in the mission-defining 'civic contribution' strand of Ulster University's strategic plan.
   It should appeal to all with an interest in WAP research and policy, and to those interested in using data to effectively target resources and interventions. It will showcase how Ulster University adopts an effective collaborative approach to meet WAP objectives that helps inform and influence decision-makers and WAP policy.
   This approach involves partnerships between colleagues from the Directorate which has statutory responsibility for WAP reporting, working with colleagues from Planning, Faculty, working groups and sub-committees/committees, such as, the Widening Access and Community Engagement Sub-Committee (WACESC), in order to source, interpret and report on a range of key data streams. Such colleagues work collaboratively and in partnership to ensure that necessary datasets are available to allow the University to appropriately monitor the diversity of the student profile for statutory reporting; for WAP planning; to meet key informational demands; to identify novel informational resources necessary to underpin institutional WAP strategy and support research.
   The data results and narrative outputs are used to support many purposes including: to better understand and monitor the WAP landscape; to define WAP criteria which encourages inclusivity; to target and plan WAP outreach and interventions, to identify marketing segments; to identify students at risk of non-progression and to make effective use of learner analytics during the entire student lifecycle from pre-application, through time at University and beyond to employment or further study.
   The presenters will provide opportunities for the research potential of learning gain to be explored and will also disseminate information about some of the key datasets used and how results are being shared to inform practice, evaluate impact and as a strategic driver for civic contribution.
   Future plans and the benefits of developing further impact strategies and designing meaningful dashboards to share data will be discussed. Presenters will also provide insights into the different perspectives of key stakeholders who require data and need to understand it, and will discuss the complexity of distribution and co-ownership. They will share details of some of the interventions informed by data that have been delivered that have been successful, such as, how data is being used by Faculty and departments including some initial findings of projects funded though the new 2017 Civic Contribution Through Educational Outreach Scheme at Ulster University.

DE Continuing education; evaluation; interprofessional education; minority
   health
AB Interprofessional education (IPE) is one strategy for addressing health inequities; however, little attention has been paid to continuing IPE for practicing social work and healthcare professionals. This article offers guidance to faculty in social work and health-related academic units on offering continuing IPE on the topic of minority health. An interprofessional group of faculty offered a day-long conference on minority health, ethics, and social justice. The conference goal was to promote interprofessional communication in a co-learning environment and promote dialogue on social determinants of health and health equity in the state. Data were obtained from surveys and analysis of work plans developed during the conference. Workshop participants were majority White (62%), social workers (79%), and practiced for 14 years on average. The most useful topics were dementia and polypharmacy. Takeaway strategies included interprofessional work, being mindful of access to resources, and engagement in continuing education. Lessons learned include plan in advance for all professions; recruit faculty and students from multiple departments to increase interprofessional diversity; offer strategies and incentives to increase student participation; be strategic about conference location and format; and identify a strategic format and theme. IPE is a means of preparing learners for working together in their future careers to provide high-quality patient-centred care and reduce health disparities. Professional development can provide an opportunity to enhance skills to address health disparities, and learning can be significantly enhanced when participants connect with colleagues from different professions, discuss diverse opinions, and share successful practices.

AB This study investigates the relationship between urban spatial structure and energy resilience at the local level. Sub-district no.7 of District no.1 of Tehran was selected as the study area. First, to evaluate the energy resilience of 250 blocks of the study area, 28 indicators in four components of urban geometry and morphology, land use, public transportation, and passive design were adopted. Subsequently, using a hybrid factor analysis and analytic network process (F'ANP) model, flexibility, interdependence, coordination capacity, equity, efficiency, self organization, independence, and diversity were determined as the eight underlying energy resilience principles related to the spatial structure of the study area. The composite index results reveal that principles and indicators related to transportation have a more significant role in energy resilience than operational energy related ones. Also, increasing compactness without simultaneous attention to the mass-space ratio and adequate provision of green spaces does not necessarily lead to increased energy resilience and may even detract from resilience. To illustrate the practical implications of the study findings, we recommend action plans that can contribute to enhancing the energy resilience of the study area. The proposed globally applicable framework is expected to give urban planners a better understanding ofurban form and spatial structure implicationsfor energy resilience. It can also inform planning and decision making for achieving urban climate change adaptation and mitigation targets.

AB The Innovation-Corps (TM) (I-Corps) program was created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2011 to help translate NSF-funded academic research to market. Working with coordinating partner VentureWell, the NSF offers select participants from U.S. academic laboratories the opportunity to immerse themselves in a process to test and explore the opportunities and value of their ideas in the marketplace. Participants talk to potential customers, partners, and competitors to refine their research ideas into viable products using an entrepreneurial approach to meet the challenges and uncertainty of creating successful innovations. This paper summarizes panel content that was planned for the NAI Ninth Annual Meeting, which was cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns and restrictions. The purpose of the panel was to provide a range of uniquely different perspectives; thus, we have opted to maintain the question and answer format. The panelists first examine the real and perceived, or intended and unintended, outputs of I-Corps projects and then discuss the I-Corps process as the catalyst for refining and/or scaling promising research idea into a product to meet a customer need. The panelists then describe the importance of customer discovery as relevant to invention and to culturally conscious entrepreneurship and how this first step can aid basic research. The panelists highlight the opportunities and challenges of teaching a customer discovery approach in an academic setting by charging learners to ask open-ended questions to acquire a 360-degree perspective of a technological innovation. Lastly, the panelists provide a viewpoint on the execution of academic customer discovery during the current COVID-19 challenges and the potential for economic development.

TI Findings from the most recent Medical Library Association salary survey
SO JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: The objective is to provide information on basic issues in library management identified by the Medical Library Association's (MLA's) seventh triennial salary survey.
   Methods: The survey was a Web-based questionnaire. A nonrandom sample of persons was obtained by posting messages to MLA's membership and to the MEDLIB-L email discussion list. Employed MLA members and nonmembers employed in medical library settings filled out a Web-based form designed using common gateway interface (CGI) programming.
   Results: Six hundred forty-five usable responses were analyzed by the Hay Group and presented in the MLA publication, Hay Group/MLA 2001 Compensation and Benefits Survey. Results from the 2001 survey in this article focus on pay and job satisfaction. Salary survey results since 1983 were analyzed to review trends in seniority, diversity, and pay equity.
   Conclusions: Given the age progression of respondents from 1983 to 2001, it is clear that succession planning is a core issue for medical libraries. Although efforts to create more diversity in medical libraries in member organizations have started to yield results, pay for white respondents has increased at a higher rate than for other racial categories. The authors found that the pay-for-performance system in the organizations of approximately two-thirds of the respondents is suboptimized and that most of the reasons medical librarians cite for leaving their organization can be addressed and potentially changed by management. Results from the eighth salary survey, slated to be conducted in the fall of 2004, will further track these trends and issues.

ID IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE; MEDICINE
AB The clinical application of genetics and genomics to advance precision health is one of the most dynamic and promising areas of medicine. In 2020, building on nearly 15 years of work, the Roundtable on Genomics and Precision Health of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine undertook a strategic planning process to assess its strengths, consider the current challenges facing the field, and set out new goals for its future work. As a result, the Roundtable has updated its vision and mission and prioritized four major areas of inquiry-innovation, dialogue, equity, and adoption-while keeping true to its founding goal of providing a neutral convening space for the diversity of stakeholders in genomics and precision health. The Roundtable is unique for its breadth of membership and is committed to fostering a new era for precision health built on decades of expanding knowledge and the emergence of new technologies. To achieve its goals, the Roundtable seeks to broaden its membership's diversity and to engage with new audiences. Roundtable members explore how evidence-based discoveries in genomics could be adopted and used in innovative ways to better serve human health, how equitable access to genomic and precision health technologies can be ensured, and how the Roundtable and broader genomics and precision health community can communicate more effectively to inform the public regarding genomics and precision health. As a first principle, the Roundtable is working to support the overall goal that all people benefit from genomics for precision health.

AB The structure, composition and diversity of the floodplain forest (SMPC) of Bravaisia integerrima were studied in the two largest forest stands in Tabasco, Mexico: the Ecological Reserve Yu-Balcah (YCAH) with 271 ha, and State Park La Chontalpa (PECH) with 191 ha. In each forest stand 10 plots of 1000 m(2) were sampled. Tree individuals sampled were identified to species, and evaluated in three age categories, seedlings, saplings, and adults. The relationship between species richness and sampling effort was analyzed using Chao 2, ICE, Jacknife 1, Jacknife 2 and Bootstrap. The structural analysis was based on the importance value index. The diversity of species was evaluated, using the Margalef index (D-Mg), alpha de Fisher, Shannon-Wiener (H') and equity of Pielou J. The dominance indices of Berger-Parker (d) and Simpson (D) were also used. The total number of species was 76, belonging to 64 genera and 33 botanical families. The richest family was Leguminosae with 15 species. The basal area of the sites YCAH and PECH was 37.2 and 29.5 m(2)ha(-1), respectively. Bravaisia integerrima was the most important tree species in all stands, with an Importance Index of 277. The value of the Shannon index was 2.0 in both sites. YCAH showed the best ecological condition. Six species present in the stands are considered as threatened in Mexico (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010). The current extent of the floodplain forest of Bravaisia in Tabasco State is 490 ha. The results suggest that the structure and composition of this forest has been affected by human activity. As a consequence, to guarantee the conservation of these remnants of SMPC in Tabasco, it is important to verify their legal situation and the application of management plans, designed to improve the productive activities of the rural communities that live around the stands. To succeed in this endeavor, it is necessary that governmental actors, academics, non-governmental organizations, and civil society work together.

   community engagement; experiment; oppression; underserved
AB In 1967, the University of Maryland's School of Library and Information Services created a public library in Prince George's County, Maryland, named the High John Experiment, to give Librarianship and Information Science students experience serving disadvantaged communities and to discover new methods to better serve these communities. From the creation of High John to the present day, University of Maryland publications and unaffiliated works credit High John as a groundbreaking experiment that propelled interests in diversity and inclusion in public libraries. High John's creators published a 73 paged report for the United States' Office of Education, accompanied by published articles, that confirms a violation of ethics toward the community High John served. The community was not involved in the implementation or planning of the library and many of the services and materials the library offered were based on prejudiced assumptions instead of community input or research. Although High John garnered supporters, the validity and ethicality behind High John's intent and methods were called into question during the experiment. The controversy led to debates within the field that resulted in conversations about Librarianship and Information Science pedagogy and appropriate methods in outreach and community engagement for disadvantaged communities. Now that the passionately fueled debates on High John have ceased, the experiment is a distant memory. Although this experiment led to debates about diversity, inclusion, and equity in information access within the United States, this experiment is relevant to information readers on a global scale. Because Librarianship and Information Science has a history rooted in elitism and oppression worldwide, High John warrants further exposure and examination from a diverse pool of contemporary perspectives. Through the application of modern community outreach and engagement practices, this article builds on a critical historical analysis of the experiment and argues High John failed in its mission and violated the community's trust that it purported to serve.

   Communication
AB From a global pandemic to the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and others in the Black community, the year 2020 has cast light on long-standing social injustices. With this has come a critical social movement and a call for change-specifically, a call for transformative solutions that address not only new challenges but also centuries of systemic issues, such as systemic oppression and systemic racism. Leadership across the globe has scrambled to answer the call, some issuing statements committed to change, others engaging in necessary action. What is critical, however, is that leadership understands the cultural factors that have given rise to centuries of oppressive practices, and that leaders are held accountable for the commitments they have expressed. Leadership must promote, create, and maintain prosocial, inclusive, and healthy work environments. This requires new cultural practices and a focused organizational model. Equally important is the need to resolve ambiguity and communicate effectively, with strategic consideration of constituent perspectives and needs. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to discuss the contribution of behavior analysis to addressing systemic oppression, as well as the pivotal role leadership communication plays in occasioning social change. It is our hope that this conceptual work will inspire behavior scientists to advance the field of behavior analysis and social movements in the direction of equitable, prosocial change that dismantles systemic oppression.

AB Purpose In September 2015 protests erupted at the University of Missouri following a series of racist incidents on campus and culminating in the resignation of the university president in November 2015. In solidarity with the protests student activists at universities across the United States and Canada organized into the Black Liberation Collective and held the first #StudentBlackoutOut day of protests on university campuses on November 15 followed by the publication of lists of demands to over 80 colleges in 28 states, the District of Columbia and Canada in the hopes of creating more-equitable and inclusive institutions. These demands shared similarity in requests for equity as those put forth during the Black Campus Movement of the late 1960s which led to the establishment of Black studies and cultural centers at colleges and universities. Academic libraries in particular were included with several demands to better serve the Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) community. Design/methodology/approach While librarianship has largely been a historically White profession, libraries have undertaken many diversity and inclusion initiatives over the years. This article will examine seven case studies concerning college and university libraries addressing demands collated by the Black Liberation Collective in 2015. Six years out from the publication of the lists, we will evaluate statements issued by the libraries and posted on their websites, the promises that have been made to address inequities and the ensuing actions the libraries have taken to create a welcoming, inclusive community. Findings The authors examine seven institutions where demands from student activists speak directly to the library. We examine the library's response to make changes and subsequent actions. Originality/value The authors take a journalist approach to their research and examination of library responses.

TI An action research case study: digital equity and educational inclusion
   during an emergent COVID-19 divide
SO JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to share responses from current literature, a small case study about perceptions and practices of the school of education faculty toward multicultural and educational issues concerning the rapid rise in online environments during coronavirus (COVID-19) experiences and just-in-time strategies for addressing digital equity and educational inclusion in K-16 online educational settings.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This is a conceptual paper that emerged from an action research case study. The study included four faculty in an urban school of education. The faculty participants were asked to provide examples of educational inclusion strategies used during transitioning their courses and advising to online environments in a Research I university. Faculty included one educational leadership, one sports management, one special education and one teacher education professor. Central issues explored practices related to language, technology access, curriculum design and technological competencies and assessment. A driving question was: How do institutions, schools or educators provide learning opportunities to support digital equity and inclusive education practice to maintain and strengthen relationships and core practices of multicultural education during a time of physical distancing during COVID-19? And what are the experiences, barriers, successes?
   Findings
   Research-based transformative knowledge, real situations and practical resources for considering inclusive education curriculum concepts were found that are connecting educators, teachers, learners and communities during this time of crisis.
   Research limitations/implications
   Methodological limitations that influenced the research design include conducting research in a totally virtual environment, small sample size, lack of diversity in curriculum content and one research site. The data collection was limited to written responses from the faculty participants. This action research study took place in a time frame limited by COVID-19 conditions during a four-month period.
   Practical implications
   In theory and practice, this new online movement suggests learners, teachers, educators and leaders are gaining experience and knowledge about resources and strategies for using new technologies, assessments and flexible curriculum as powerful tools for building language, curriculum and social-cultural communication bonds across generations and including special needs populations. Such new and emerging strategies could be used to bridge gaps in a time of distancing to support inclusive and equitable learning environments in education to minimize the effects of an emergent COVID-19 digital divide. Social learning culture as constructed, performed and captured in patterns of cooperation among faculties shows the world becoming more open and less restricted by borders. In conclusion, an emerging new conceptual framework is presented in Figure 2 to support action planning to bridge the digital equity access and learning gaps created by COVID-19.
   Social implications
   It is in times of strife and difficulty that problems and issues become exacerbated. While some educators easily adapted and took on the challenges of online learning, others needed time for learning and mourning (literally and figuratively). The issues of equity and access have become even more apparent as this paper takes inventory of intersections between multicultural education, special education, sports education and K-16 education overall.
   This is an excellent time to reflect on how education can address the cultural, economic and social barriers that impact student learning globally for all learners.
   Originality/value
   The brief collective case study reports educational experiences during a time of crisis that stimulates creative and innovative approaches to creating inclusive and equitable online learning environments to address diverse learning needs. The various and often contrasting educator responses from faculty facing digital and educational challenges present ideas that might be applicable in the global learning environment beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

   opportunity; Social mobility
ID EFFICIENCY; EDUCATION; MARKET
AB The aim of this article is to provide more evidence regarding the effects of the free choice of school on equal opportunities, and, thus, on the equity of the educational system, based on the experiences and statements of families themselves. This work is part of a much broader empirical study carried out in Zaragoza in 2013-2015, entitled "Choosing a school in Aragon: parental reasoning and strategies in choosing a school"). The interviews (43 done in depth) and questionnaires (covering 1 837 families) raised three factors that determine parental participation in the selection process: scope, diversity, and quality of the educational offer. Two variables are highlighted that strongly affect family participation in the choice of school: the level of parental education, and family income, which determine the fact that, although there are eligible schools, they are not always accessible to all families. All have the opportunity to choose, but those opportunities are fewer for those who have less. That direct relationship has a name: inequality, functioning as a silent but effective mechanism for social segregation. The conclusion is that freedom of choice per se does not guarantee equal opportunities, and that, if it does not go hand-in-hand with policies aimed at reducing the initial inequalities that exist between families, freedom of choice becomes a subliminal form of social segregation that exists between families, freedom of choice becomes a subliminal form of social segregation.

AB Informed choice is internationally recognised and accepted as an important aspect of ethical healthcare. In the UK, NHS antenatal screening policies state that their primary aim is to facilitate reproductive informed choices. These policies, implemented within a multiethnic population, are largely guided by the ethical principle of autonomy. This study was carried out in 2009 in the UK and used Q-methodology to explore diversity in the value attached to autonomous informed choice in antenatal screening for genetic disorders and similarities and differences in this value in women from different ethnic origins. Ninety-eight participants of African, British White, Caribbean, Chinese and Pakistani origin completed a 41-statement Q-sort in English, French, Mandarin or Urdu. Q-Factor analysis produced five statistically independent viewpoints of the value of informed choice: choice as an individual right; choice informed by religious values; choice as a shared responsibility; choice advised by health professionals; and choice within the family context. The findings show that women hold a variety of views on the nature of informed choice, and that, contradictory to policies of autonomous informed choice, many women seek and value the advice of health professionals. The findings have implications for the role of health professionals in facilitating informed choice, quality of care and equity of access. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food and nutrition security remain at the top of development priorities in low income countries. This is especially the case for smallholder farmers who derive their livelihood from agriculture yet are often the most deprived. Inclusive agribusinesses have been championed as a key strategy to address local constraints that limit smallholders' participation in regional and global value chains, thereby enhancing their livelihood, and food and nutrition security, accordingly. In this paper, based on a mixed method research approach, we explore the potential food and security contribution of inclusive agribusiness in Makueni county, Kenya. We focus on the smallholders' constraints and needs, exploring the extent to which these are addressed by such purported pro-poor approach. First, using independent samplet-tests and a probit regression model, we explore who are able to participate in an ongoing intervention. We compare how participants and non-participants differ in terms of key socio-economic characteristics and establish which of these attributes are associated with successful integration into the business. Second, we again use independent samplet-tests to determine how the participants and non-participants compare in terms of their food and nutrition security. The household food and nutrition security is assessed with the conventional measurement tools: the household food insecurity access scale and the household food dietary diversity score. We find that participation in the inclusive agribusiness favors smallholder households with relatively higher production capacity in terms of better physical capital (land and number of mango trees, financial capital), access to loans, and human capital (age, education, and family size). Following income improvement, the participants' household food security situation is significantly better than for non-participants. However, participation does not improve household dietary diversity, implying that improvement in income does not necessarily lead to better household nutrition security. To address the limitations of inclusive agribusiness, we propose policymakers and development actors to critically explore the contextual background prior to intervention design and implementation, and accordingly devise a broader approach for more inclusivity of the very poor and marginalized, and better food and nutrition security outcomes as a result. Given that not every smallholder could benefit from inclusive agribusiness for their food needs due to resource scarcity, alternative livelihood supports, including social protection programs and safety net plans, should be considered.

TI Are Women Proportionately Represented as Speakers at Orthopaedic Surgery
   Annual Meetings? A Cross-Sectional Analysis
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background In spite of efforts to improve gender diversity in orthopaedic surgery, women remain underrepresented, particularly with increasing academic rank. Opportunities to speak at society meetings are an important component of building a national reputation and achieving academic promotions. However, little is known about the gender diversity of orthopaedic society annual meeting speakers. Data on this topic are needed to determine whether these speaking roles are equitably distributed between men and women, which is fundamental to equalizing professional opportunity in academic orthopaedic surgery.
   Question/purposes (1) Is the gender diversity of invited speakers at annual orthopaedic subspecialty society meetings proportional to society membership? (2) Are there differences in the proportion of women invited to speak in technical sessions (defined as sessions on surgical outcomes, surgical technique, nonsurgical musculoskeletal care, or basic science) versus nontechnical sessions (such as sessions on diversity, work-life balance, work environment, social media, education, or peer relationships)? (3) Does the presence of women on the society executive committee and annual meeting program committee correlate with the gender diversity of invited speakers? (4) Do societies with explicit diversity efforts (the presence of a committee, task force, award, or grant designed to promote diversity, or mention of diversity as part of the organization's mission statement) have greater gender diversity in their invited speakers?
   Methods Seventeen national orthopaedic societies in the United States were included in this cross-sectional study of speakership in 2018. Each society provided the number of men and women members for their society in 2018. The genders of all invited speakers were tabulated using each society's 2018 annual meeting program. Speakers of all credentials and degrees were included. All manuscript/abstract presenters were excluded from all analyses because these sessions are selected by blinded scientific review. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of women versus men in nontechnical speaking roles. The relationship between women in society leadership roles and women in all speaking roles was investigated using a linear regression analysis. A chi square test was used to compare the proportion of women in all speaking roles between societies with stated diversity efforts with societies without such initiatives.
   Results Overall, women society members were proportionately represented as annual meeting speakers, comprising 13% (4389 of 33,051) of all society members and 14% (535 of 3928) of all annual meeting speakers (% difference 0.6% [95% CI -0.8 to 1.5]; p = 0.60); however, representation of women speakers ranged from 0% to 33% across societies. Women were more likely than men to have nontechnical speaking roles, with 6% (32 of 535) of women's speaking roles being nontechnical, compared with 2% (51 of 3393) of men's speaking roles being non-technical (OR 4.2 [95% CI 2.7 to 6.5]; p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the proportion of women in society leadership roles and the proportion of women in speaking roles (r = 0.73; p < 0.001). Societies with a stated diversity effort had more women as conference speakers; with 19% (375 of 1997) women speakers for societies with a diversity effort compared with 8% (160 of 1931) women speakers in societies without a diversity effort (OR 2.6 [95% CI 2.1 to 3.1]; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Although the percentage of women in speaking roles was proportional to society membership overall, our study identified opportunities to improve gender representation in several societies and in technical versus nontechnical sessions. Positioning more women in leadership roles and developing stated diversity efforts are two interventions that may help societies improve proportional representation; we recommend that all societies monitor the gender representation of speakers at their annual meetings and direct conference organizing committees to create programs with gender equity.
   Clinical Relevance Society leadership, national oversight committees, invited speakers, and conference attendees all contribute to the layers of accountability for equitable speakership at annual meetings. National steering committees such as the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Diversity Advisory Board should monitor and report conference speaker diversity data to create system-wide accountability. Conference attendees and speakers should critically examine conference programs and raise concerns if they notice inequities. With these additional layers of accountability, orthopaedic surgery annual meetings may become more representative of their society members.

ID RELEVANCE
AB Research background: In the economic literature there are many arguments presented by critical supporters and opponents of measuring and reporting comprehensive income. There is a justified need to examine the relevance and usefulness of comprehensive income, especially the predictive power of comprehensive in-come for forecasting future earnings. It may be assumed that the comprehensive income has a better predictive power for future bank performance than net income, because this measure includes many elements, which were previously presented in the statement of changes in equity.
   Purpose of the article: The major subject of the theoretical-empirical study presented in this paper is the evaluation of the usefulness of comprehensive income for predicting banks' future earnings. Realization of the fundamental objective of this paper was centered around the main research hypothesis, stating that in economic practice of banks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange it can be assumed that there is a positive predictive power of financial result in forecasting financial standing of these entities.
   Methods: The research comprised bank joint-stock companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (qualified on 15.09.2016). Empirical data for the study was obtained from the quarterly financial statements (the period from 2009 to 2015) from EMIS. The problem was realized in two analytical dimensions: absolute dimension financial results, and a relative dimension (return ratios). The research method was the regression analysis conducted by means of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and by two regression models in two versions.
   Findings & Value added: The research showed that the analyzed bank companies were characterized by a diversity usefulness of comprehensive income for predicting banks' future earnings. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficients confirm in most instances a positive character of dependence between the comprehensive income and future return ratios. The results of the estimation of econometric models shows the positive association of comprehensive income with future profitability of banks.

AB To address the low levels of underrepresented minority (URM) faculty in top-ranked chemistry departments, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health jointly sponsored a workshop for academic chemistry leaders in September 2007. The goal of the two-and-a-half-day workshop was to create an informed and committed community of chemistry leaders who will develop and promote programs and strategies to advance racial and ethnic equity in both the faculty and student body with the goal of increasing the number of U.S. citizens who are URM scientists. This paper reports the impact of this workshop on the attitudes of the department chair faculty members who attended the workshop. On the basis of surveys of the department chair faculty perceptions before and after the workshop, the results indicate that participants in the carefully planned intervention workshop changed their attitudes regarding reasons underlying the underrepresentation and barriers that minority faculty face in the field. These department chair faculty members also increasingly viewed the solution to diversifying chemistry departments as one in which they, their departments, and universities could play a role.

AB BACKGROUND
   Teaching sexuality education to support young people's sexual development and overall sexual health is both needed and supported. Data continue to highlight the high rates of teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, among young people in the United States as well as the overwhelming public support for sexuality education instruction. In support of the implementation of the National Sexuality Education Standards, the current effort focuses on better preparing teachers to deliver sexuality education.
   METHODS
   An expert panel was convened by the Future of Sex Education Initiative to develop teacher-preparation standards for sexuality education. Their task was to develop standards and indicators that addressed the unique elements intrinsic to sexuality education instruction.
   RESULTS
   Seven standards and associated indicators were developed that address professional disposition, diversity and equity, content knowledge, legal and professional ethics, planning, implementation, and assessment.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The National Teacher-Preparation Standards for Sexuality Education represent an unprecedented unified effort to enable prospective health education teachers to become competent in teaching methodology, theory, practice of pedagogy, content, and skills, specific to sexuality education. Higher education will play a key role in ensuring the success of these standards.

AB Recent events prompted scientists in the United States and throughout the world to consider how systematic racism affects the scientific enterprise. This paper provides evidence of inequities related to race-ethnicity and gender in graduate school experiences and career plans of PhD students in the top 100 ranked departments in one science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) discipline, chemistry. Mixed-model regression analyses were used to examine factors that might moderate these differences. The results show that graduate students who identified as a member of a racial/ethnic group traditionally underrepresented in chemistry (underrepresented minorities, URM) were significantly less likely than other students to report that their financial support was sufficient to meet their needs. They were also less likely to report having supportive relationships with peers and postdocs. Women, and especially URM women, were significantly less likely to report supportive relationships with advisors. Despite their more negative experiences in graduate school, students who identified as URM expressed greater commitment to finishing their degree and staying in the field. When there was at least one faculty member within their departments who also identified as URM they were also more likely than other students to aspire to a university professorship with an emphasis on research. Men were significantly more likely than women to express strong commitment to finishing the PhD and remaining in chemistry, but this difference was stronger in top-ranked departments. Men were also more likely than women to aspire to a professorship with an emphasis on research, and this difference remained when individual and departmental-level variables were controlled.

AB Recent research in city planning has measured "walkability" and multi-modalism through quantification of the built environment. Results have shown correlations with increased property values and neighbourhood stabilisation as well as a lack of spatial distribution of accessible resources based on socio-economic class. Some studies suggest that improvements in these measures can be made, particularly with regard to commute mode diversity. This study tests and scrutinises the association between a walkability index and multimodal travel behaviour - controlling for both built environment and socio-demographic attributes of agents in investigating stated non-vehicular transportation modes. It finds that walkability indexes are connected to multimodal behaviours broadly; whether it be those who walking, bicycling, and or taking transit. It also finds that distance is a significantly associated with transit behaviour in walkable neighbourhoods, but the probability of walking or cycling is tied more to the built environment factors, age, household income and size. These results suggest that cities might benefit from policy efforts that not only continue to address issues of spatial equity but that they might consider policies that promote income mobility to encourage sustainable travel.

AB In the context of the changes that have occurred in the Romanian society, the public authorities are required to play a coordinating role in providing the framework for a sustainable and balanced development of the national territory, and to ensure the quality of life of the citizens. In order to achieve these goals of social responsibility, the public administration authorities must build and adapt the tools of public territorial action based on their specificity and within the existing legal framework and resources,. Thus, the study shows the national and European context that frames the actions of public administration for what concerns the sustainable territorial development. It analyzes the characteristics of administrative- territorial structures of Romania, highlighting their socio- demographic diversity and the territorial forms of institutional cooperation. The approach of these issues is based in the first instance on an analysis of the European strategic documents in the field, as well as on the national regulations concerning the organization and functioning of public administration and territorial planning. The implementation of decentralization and local public autonomy has led to the capitalization of the local potential of some administrative divisions and caused a competition and a difficult cooperation between them. By analogy with the provisions of the quality standards regarding the responsibilities of the organizations towards customers, the study illustrates and analyzes the responsibilities and limits of public administration authorities in promoting sustainable development, territorial equity and the quality of life for the users of public services, i.e. the community members.

   Data and methods: Findings are based on two rounds of NFHS (3 & 4). Liberson's Diversity Index has been used to assess the inequality in women's empowerment. Multiple regression analysis is used to portray the relationship and logistic regression is used to access the adjusted effects of various dimensions of women's empowerment on use of contraception.
   Results: Varying degrees of equity in women's empowerment across different states of India builds a combative relationship with uptake of contraceptive methods. Results portray a positive association between inequality in household decision making, engaged in paid work in last 12 months and having 10 years of schooling with use of any modern method. Women who participated in household decision making (OR = 1.17 p < 0.005), using mobile phone (OR = 1.23 p < 0.005) and working and were paid in cash in last 12 months (OR = 1.37 p < 0.005) are significantly more likely to use any method of contraception.
   Conclusions: Status of women in India has improved in different dimensions, yet the patriarchal norms influence the decision of using contraception. The current women-centric bottom-top approach in implementation of family planning programme should focus at the women's right to decision on their own life and health. Such efforts should hinge at strengthening inter personal counseling and capacity building sessions by outreach workers, which may empower women with enhanced knowledge about their health and bodily rights.

AB A comprehensive review of abundant researches and training plans about cultural diversity persistently refers us to students' integration school concept with a migrant background. However, their unequal and not very encouraging academic path lead us to an inexcusable disintegration and school exclusion of them. The polarization and segregation of schools, the dropout from the education system in secondary school and the low rate of such students at university confirm the reckless disharmony produced in the last three decades, due to the lack of quality, equity and educational efficiency in this subject management. The aim of this work is to analyse, in a transversal way, pedagogical and institutional aspects associated with the care of migrant students and their link with their segregation and exclusion from school, such as low involvement of migrant families in the school dynamic, scarce teacher training, teacher rotation, absence of intercultural mediators, etc. All of that is to encourage reflection on possible inclusive, coherent and forceful responses that will guarantee the school success of the next generation, but this question does not only deserve academic interest, also it is a matter of moral, political, and social urgency.

ID ADAPTIVE EXPERTISE
AB Recently, theorists have raised concerns that pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has become "a stale metaphor" that disregards diversity and equity, offers little to help teachers address students' misconceptions, and portrays knowledge as "in the head" versus in practice. We refute these notions using grounded theory to specify ways one 7th-grade science teacher enacted PCK to advance student learning. With the definition of PCK as knowledge at the intersection of content and teaching, we utilised a framework for science PCK to explore instructional decision-making. Interviews conducted over three years revealed specific ways the teacher enacted PCK by designing and delivering instruction built on each of the seven conceptual science PCK components. The teacher enacted PCK to plan and deliver instruction that was responsive, adaptive, and considerate of changing needs of students and the changing classroom landscape. She infused PCK into instructional decision-making, instructional interactions, and mentoring of a student teacher, modelling the translation of educational theory into practice and habits of mind necessary for expert teaching. This enactment actively refutes Settlage's critiques, and depicts PCK as a vibrant and effective stance for teaching that enhances learning.

AB Over the last 50 years, 370 large cities worldwide have severely depopulated, or shrunk, by at least 10%. Johnstown, Pennsylvania, is the third fastest U.S. shrinking city. Primarily a victim of deindustrialization, Johnstown faces severe decline issues related to depopulation, including social disorder and lowered quality of life. This project develops a framework for urban design for shrinking cities, integrating permanent functions into high development potential areas but temporary functions into declining areas. This approach allows for future development to occur through time as the city recovers. Using a GIS-based weighted overlay model to assess the threat level of decline, 4 sites were identified and strategies for each were developed. Master plans to retrofit new functions integrating residents' desire and demands into vacant / abandoned properties were then generated for each site. Rather than chasing hefty attempted quick-hitting developmental incentives, this approach will bring new long-term economic engines and lifestyles to the city due to a diversity in the economic base; it also pays attention to the social dimension of urban regeneration by providing a structured way to promoting social justice and equity in shrinking cities.

AB Medical education institutions have a social mandate to produce a diverse physician workforce that meets the public's needs. Recent reports have framed the admission process outcome of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education (UGME and PGME) programs as a key determinant of the collective contributions graduating cohorts will make to society, creating a sense of urgency around the issue of who gets accepted. The need for evidence-informed residency application and selection processes is growing because of the increasing size and diversity of the applicant pool and the need for equity, fairness, social accountability, and health human resource planning. The selection literature, however, is dominated by a UGME focus and emphasizes determination of desirable qualities of future physicians and selection instrument reliability and validity. Gaps remain regarding PGME selection, particularly the creation of specialty-specific selection criteria, suitable outcome measures, and reliable selection systems.
   In this Perspective, the authors describe the University of Toronto's centralized approach to defining system-level best practices for residency application and selection. Over the 2012-2013 academic year, the Best Practices in Application and Selection working group reviewed relevant literature and reports, consulted content experts, surveyed local practices, and conducted iterative stakeholder consultations on draft recommendations. Strong agreement arose around the resulting 13 principles and 24 best practices, which had either empirical support or face validity. These recommendations, which are shared in this article, have been adopted by the university's PGME advisory committee and will inform a national initiative to improve trainees' transition from UGME to PGME in Canada.

AB The authors assume that alterglobalization is a process of global alternative economic, political and cultural integration, aimed at diffusion of global transnational influence, ecological-local stability and humancenteredness.
   To show the today prospect of alterglobal inclusive development, the authors demonstrate the connections between environmentally related taxes, percentage of the total tax revenue, real GDP per capita, and percentage of recycling in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, the USA and the Netherlands. Combinations of the abovementioned indicators show the extent of the presence of ecologically oriented model of development with the use of new technologies in different countries. The highest connections among the chosen indicators have been found out in Poland and the Czech Republic which determines strong prospect for the successful implementation of the inclusive circular businesses in the countries. The situation in the Netherlands is somewhat different from the one in other countries due to the size of real GDP per capita and a higher level of corporate and state contribution in the development of the circular strategy.
   It is argued that economic globalization causes delocalisation and disability of local communities and economies. Meanwhile, alterglobalization involves the benefits from the uniqueness, diversity and comprehensiveness of its participants. The alterglobal imperatives of the development of "network society" have been singled out. The authors stress that alterglobalism does not contradict globalization in general, but it offers other, more human-centered projects of globalization with lesser impact from the side of multinational corporations and central governments.
   It has been concluded that economic growth of both the national and global economies needs new momentum (plan "B") that is acceptable to most of the participating countries in the face of global competition and numerous signs of the metaphoric "sea star wasting syndrome". In spite of the absence of a single centre for global decision-making, there is a danger that the future political regime of governance may be rather authoritarian than democratic, and decisions on global problems will be taken by a limited number of subjects of international relations. Under such economic and political threats, inclusivity and circular economy are seen as processes capable of delivering benefits to humanity without harming the environment and the human being.

AB Seventeen years ago Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995) published the landmark article "Toward a Theory of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy," giving a coherent theoretical statement for resource pedagogies that had been building throughout the 1970s and 1980s. I, like countless teachers and university-based researchers, have been inspired by what it means to make teaching and learning relevant and responsive to the languages, literacies, and cultural practices of students across categories of difference and (in) equality. Recently, however, I have begun to question if the terms " relevant" and " responsive" are really descriptive of much of the teaching and research founded upon them and, more importantly, if they go far enough in their orientation to the languages and literacies and other cultural practices of communities marginalized by systemic inequalities to ensure the valuing and maintenance of our multiethnic and multilingual society. In this essay, I offer the term and stance of culturally sustaining pedagogy as an alternative that, I believe, embodies some of the best research and practice in the resource pedagogy tradition and as a term that supports the value of our multiethnic and multilingual present and future. Culturally sustaining pedagogy seeks to perpetuate and foster-to sustain-linguistic, literate, and cultural pluralism as part of the democratic project of schooling. In the face of current policies and practices that have the explicit goal of creating a monocultural and monolingual society, research and practice need equally explicit resistances that embrace cultural pluralism and cultural equality.

AB This study investigates the key factors that elicit financial reporting fraud among companies in Malaysia. Using enforcement action releases issued by the Security Commission of Malaysia (SC) and Bursa Malaysia, we identify a sample of 76 firms that had committed financial reporting fraud during the period of 1996-2016. We use the fraud triangle framework and the Malaysian International Standards on Auditing 240 to identify the factors. Since the simple probit model fails to address the identification problem (partial observability), we estimate our results using a bivariate probit model. The new model estimates the effects of pressure, opportunity, and rationalization on the probability of fraud likelihood by disentangling the detection probability of fraud. Among several proxies used for pressure, our results suggest that aggressive tax reporting and financial difficulties increase the likelihood of fraud commission. In regard to opportunity, we find that dedicated institutional investors, independence of the board, effective audit committee, and the presence of a female on the board provide active monitoring and oversight in reducing fraud occurrence. Results for rationalization suggest that prior violations and frequent changes of external auditors increase the chances of fraud occurrence. This research offers possible insights to auditors, managers, and regulators to prevent, detect, and react to fraud. Specifically, it highlights the specific factors that may exacerbate the fraudulent intentions of firms.

AB Background: Local authorities in England commission the NHS Health Check programme to invite everyone aged 40-74 years without pre-existing conditions for risk assessment and eventual intervention, if needed. However, the programme's effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equity impact remain uncertain.
   Aim: To develop a validated open-access flexible web-based model that enables local commissioners to quantify the cost-effectiveness and potential for equitable population health gain of the NHS Health Check programme.
   Objectives: The objectives were as follows: (1) co-produce with stakeholders the desirable features of the user-friendly model; (2) update the evidence base to support model and scenario development; (3) further develop our computational model to allow for developments and changes to the NHS Health Check programme and the diseases it addresses; (4) assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and equity of alternative strategies for implementation to illustrate the use of the tool; and (5) propose a sustainability and implementation plan to deploy our user-friendly computational model at the local level.
   Design: Co-production workshops surveying the best-performing local authorities and a systematic literature review of strategies to increase uptake of screening programmes informed model use and development. We then co-produced the workHORSE (working Health Outcomes Research Simulation Environment) model to estimate the health, economic and equity impact of different NHS Health Check programme implementations, using illustrative-use cases.
   Setting: Local authorities in England.
   Participants: Stakeholders from local authorities, Public Health England, the NHS, the British Heart Foundation, academia and other organisations participated in the workshops. For the local authorities survey, we invited 16 of the best-performing local authorities in England.
   Interventions: The user interface allows users to vary key parameters that represent programme activities (i.e. invitation, uptake, prescriptions and referrals). Scenarios can be compared with each other.
   Main outcome measures: Disease cases and case-years prevented or postponed, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, net monetary benefit and change in slope index of inequality.
   Results: The survey of best-performing local authorities revealed a diversity of effective approaches to maximise the coverage and uptake of NHS Health Check programme, with no distinct 'best buy'. The umbrella literature review identified a range of effective single interventions. However, these generally need to be combined to maximally improve uptake and health gains. A validated dynamic, stochastic microsimulation model, built on robust epidemiology, enabled service options analysis. Analyses of three contrasting illustrative cases estimated the health, economic and equity impact of optimising the Health Checks, and the added value of obtaining detailed local data. Optimising the programme in Liverpool can become cost-effective and equitable, but simply changing the invitation method will require other programme changes to improve its performance. Detailed data inputs can benefit local analysis.
   Limitations: Although the approach is extremely flexible, it is complex and requires substantial amounts of data, alongside expertise to both maintain and run.
   Conclusions: Our project showed that the workHORSE model could be used to estimate the health, economic and equity impact comprehensively at local authority level. It has the potential for further development as a commissioning tool and to stimulate broader discussions on the role of these tools in real-world decision-making.
   Future work: Future work should focus on improving user interactions with the model, modelling simulation standards, and adapting workHORSE for evaluation, design and implementation support.

AB This study critically examines 20 years of geography and political ecology literature on the energy justice implications of climate change mitigation. Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions-including renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management-with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies, multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake. Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon world more pluralistic, democratic, and just.

AB Racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities are more likely to report challenges with oncology provider communication and quality of care. The Together-Equitable-Accessible-Meaningful (TEAM) training was developed to improve health equity across cancer care organizations by guiding teams of interprofessional learners through planning and implementation of quality improvements to advance equitable, accessible, and patient-centered cancer care. This study compared changes to self-reported cultural competence as measured by the Cultural Competency Assessment (CCA); Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS); and Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS). The primary aim of the study was to assess changes to self-reported cultural competence; the secondary aim was to examine changes to interprofessional valuation from baseline to post-intervention. Results indicated statistically significant improvements in self-reported Cultural Competency Behaviors (p = .055), a subscale of the CCA, and Attitudinal Awareness toward sexual and gender minorities (p = .046), a subscale of the LGBT-DOCSS, usingp < .10 as statistically significant. These subscale results drove statistically significant improvements for their respective composite scales. No other statistically significant results were found. This study suggests that cultural competency training among interprofessional oncology health care professionals can be effective. Given the growing diversity within the USA, additional opportunities for cultural competency training are needed.

ID PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; HEALTH RESEARCH; SCIENCE
AB Efforts to move community engagement in research from marginalized to mainstream include the NIH requiring community engagement programs in all Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how little these efforts have changed the dominant culture of clinical research. When faced with the urgent need to generate knowledge about prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus, researchers largely neglected to involve community stakeholders early in the research process. This failure cannot be divorced from the broader context of systemic racism in the US that has contributed to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities bearing a disproportionate toll from COVID-19, being underrepresented in COVID-19 clinical trials, and expressing greater hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccination. We call on research funders and research institutions to take decisive action to make community engagement obligatory, not optional, in all clinical and translational research and to center BIPOC communities in this process. Recommended actions include funding agencies requiring all research proposals involving human participants to include a community engagement plan, providing adequate funding to support ongoing community engagement, including community stakeholders in agency governance and proposal reviews, promoting racial and ethnic diversity in the research workforce, and making a course in community engaged research a requirement for Masters of Clinical Research curricula.

AB This study investigates the disparities in access to various types of opportunities in ethnic neighborhoods, as compared to wealthy white neighborhoods (the reference). Focusing on the heterogeneity within ethnic neighborhoods, I distinguish between different types of neighborhoods based on their racial/ethnic makeup and median household income. The Los Angeles region provides an interesting empirical setting because of its racial diversity and its auto-centric spatial structure. The results show that the various types of ethnic neighborhoods differ not only in spatial patterns within the region but also in terms of relative access to opportunities. Nevertheless, I find that all types of the low-income ethnic neighborhoods have higher levels of access to jobs and non-work opportunities, except for access to parks/open spaces, than do the reference neighborhoods. This holds true regardless of accessibility measures and travel modes. However, the relative access to opportunities for middle-to-high-income ethnic neighborhoods varies by accessibility measure. Considering that each accessibility measure has its own set of meanings and planning implications, diverse measures should be taken into account for policy interventions. The present study also adds further evidence of modal disparities, which are much greater than spatial disparities, in access to opportunities.

TI Accessible and Adaptable Faculty Development to Support Curriculum
   Reform in Medical Education
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Contemporary curricular reform in medical education focuses on areas that current physician-educators were likely not exposed to during medical school, such as interprofessional teamwork; informatics; health care systems improvement; and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Thus, faculty may not be ready to support the planned curricular reform without adequate faculty development to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills. In an era with increasing demands on faculty, new approaches that are flexible and adaptable are needed. The University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine implemented a new curriculum in 2016, which constituted a major curricular overhaul necessitating extensive faculty development. Based on this experience, the author proposes 8 guiding principles for faculty development around curricular reform: (1) create a blueprint to inform design and implementation of faculty development activities; (2) build on existing resources, networks, and communities; (3) target different needs and competency levels for different groups of faculty; (4) encourage cocreation in the workplace; (5) promote collaboration between content experts and faculty developers; (6) tap into faculty's intrinsic motivation for professional development; (7) develop curriculum leaders and faculty developers; and (8) evaluate for continuous improvement. Each of these principles is illustrated with examples, and when available, supported by references to relevant literature. Considering the current wave of curricular reform, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, these principles can be useful for other institutions.

TI ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ANALYZING THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE EFFECT ON
   FINANCIAL STABILITY
SO BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF
   KAZAKHSTAN
LA English
DT Article
DE automation; financial stability; liquidity; solvency; economic analysis
AB Financial stability is an important measure used by stakeholders to assess the financial situation of an entity concerned. Economic worries caused by internal business issues, global processes, and international economic (regional) integration may increase the entity's exposure to external factors. Financial stability considers the entity's dependence on creditors and investors, i.e. the debt-to-equity ratio. Significant liabilities that are not fully covered by the entity's own liquid funds create preconditions for bankruptcy should any large creditor demand settlement of any debts owed to it. However, borrowed funds can significantly increase the return on equity. Therefore, in analyzing financial stability, it is very important to use a system of indicators that indicate the entity's future risks and profitability.
   Financial stability is the principal objective of financial analysis. The nature and scope of such economic analysis are aimed to determine the entity's internal capacities, means, and methods for improving the entity's financial stability. Thus, financial stability is understood as the entity's guaranteed solvency and creditworthiness resulting from the effective formation, distribution, and application of financial resources in the entity's business operations. Financial stability is assessed based on the working capital to inventory ratio and debt to equity ratio.
   Business entities are independent in establishing business relationships with their contract partners; therefore, they are fully responsible for the decisions they make. The increasing importance of financial analysis for the entity's own financial situation and for its business partners is explained by the increasing demand for additional sources of business financing and the requirement to increase the productiveness of capital resources.
   Entity's financial stability analysis should not focus on the current financial activities only. It should also determine what measures should be taken on a continuous basis to maintain and improve the entity's financial situation. Both current and future stability, i.e. the entity's sustainability, must be ensured to provide conditions for state-of-the-art competitive production.
   An entity is a complex system consisting of many subsystems; therefore, a complex method must be applied to analyze its stability, i.e. using a system of financial stability indicators. Present-day diversity of financial stability indicators, including both absolute and relative indicators, makes the analysis difficult and overcomplicated, creating difficulties in combining the findings of the analysis to make conclusions about the entity's financial stability. Absolute indicators, namely equity, borrowed capital, assets, cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, profit, play an important role in the analysis of an entity's financial stability. Equally important are absolute indicators calculated in the analysis of financial statements: net assets, working capital, working capital to inventory ratio, stable liabilities. These indicators are criterial as they are used to establish the criteria used in the financial analysis.
   An entity should have a flexible structure of financial resources and, if necessary, be able to borrow funds. Therefore, another manifestation of an entity's potential financial stability is its creditworthiness, i.e., the ability to settle its payment obligations when due. Thus, an entity is considered creditworthy if it meets a certain requirement for granting a loan and is able to repay the loan when due subject to any interest accrued. This concept is closely related to the concept of financial stability and shows whether the company is able to raise funds from different sources to repay its debts. Credit analysis may predict solvency and is closely related to the analysis of solvency, financial stability and return on equity. Entity's stable operation, high profitability and working capital turnover also guarantee loan repayment to a certain degree.

TI Streets as Public Spaces: Lessons from Street Vending in Ahmedabad,

SO URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE equity; India; public spaces; safety; streets; street vending
AB Public spaces go beyond the typical definition of being an open space. They reflect the diversity and vibrancy of the urban fabric and hold the power to create memories. Among all public spaces, streets emerge as the most public. Streets are engines of economic activities, social hubs, and platforms for civic engagement. They break socio-economic divides and foster social cohesion. Planning, designing, and managing better public spaces have become important global discussions. Sustainable Development Goals (8 and 11) and the New Urban Agenda emphasize the significance of inclusive and sustainable economy and safe, accessible and quality public spaces for all. The proposed article uses the case of street vending to understand the manifestation of these goals in an Indian context by assessing street vendors' role in Ahmedabad's urban fabric through extensive spatial analysis of 4,000 vendors at four different time points of the day, perception studies of their clientele disaggregated by gender, income and age, and their relationship with surrounding land-use and street hierarchy. It showcases how street vendors make the streets more vibrant by increasing activities, safer through ensuring inflow of people, and inclusive in its true sense by allowing people from different backgrounds to participate in the exchange of goods and services. It further argues that street vendors are vital elements of more equitable and exciting streets and public space.

AB Purpose To advance fair and consistent comparisons of dose prediction methods for knowledge-based planning (KBP) in radiation therapy research. Methods We hosted OpenKBP, a 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge, and challenged participants to develop the best method for predicting the dose of contoured computed tomography (CT) images. The models were evaluated according to two separate scores: (a) dose score, which evaluates the full three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions, and (b) dose-volume histogram (DVH) score, which evaluates a set DVH metrics. We used these scores to quantify the quality of the models based on their out-of-sample predictions. To develop and test their models, participants were given the data of 340 patients who were treated for head-and-neck cancer with radiation therapy. The data were partitioned into training (n=200), validation (n=40), and testing (n=100) datasets. All participants performed training and validation with the corresponding datasets during the first (validation) phase of the Challenge. In the second (testing) phase, the participants used their model on the testing data to quantify the out-of-sample performance, which was hidden from participants and used to determine the final competition ranking. Participants also responded to a survey to summarize their models. Results The Challenge attracted 195 participants from 28 countries, and 73 of those participants formed 44 teams in the validation phase, which received a total of 1750 submissions. The testing phase garnered submissions from 28 of those teams, which represents 28 unique prediction methods. On average, over the course of the validation phase, participants improved the dose and DVH scores of their models by a factor of 2.7 and 5.7, respectively. In the testing phase one model achieved the best dose score (2.429) and DVH score (1.478), which were both significantly better than the dose score (2.564) and the DVH score (1.529) that was achieved by the runner-up models. Lastly, many of the top performing teams reported that they used generalizable techniques (e.g., ensembles) to achieve higher performance than their competition. Conclusion OpenKBP is the first competition for knowledge-based planning research. The Challenge helped launch the first platform that enables researchers to compare KBP prediction methods fairly and consistently using a large open-source dataset and standardized metrics. OpenKBP has also democratized KBP research by making it accessible to everyone, which should help accelerate the progress of KBP research. The OpenKBP datasets are available publicly to help benchmark future KBP research.

LA English
DT Article
DE inclusion understanding; intellectual disabilities; positive attitudes;

ID EDUCATION; SOCIETY
AB The focus of education policies on greater equity and accessibility of education for all exposes an important difference between narrow and broad definitions of the concept of inclusion. The narrow definition is tied above all to the school context, where responsibility for the realisation of inclusion lies with pedagogical workers. The broad definition refers to an understanding of inclusion as the embracing of diversity as a positive value for the community, regardless of the institutional context in which we endeavour to achieve inclusion. The research discussed the inclusive educational practice of a special educational institution catering for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Using a sample of 139 participants at the international inclusive festival Play With Me, the attitudes towards inclusion and towards persons with special needs (a Likert scale was created) were researched. The results indicate that respondents generally had positive attitudes towards inclusion; there were differences between them, depending on the roles they undertook at the festival (mentors of students taking part in the festival and volunteers running various festival activities), the institutions they came from (special or mainstream educational institutions, associations, NGOs), and whether or not they had experience of individuals with special educational needs (SEN), either in their work or in their studies. Although a broad understanding of inclusive culture is present in the statements of respondents, it appears that both general and special teachers (in the role of mentors) still incline slightly more towards a narrow understanding of inclusion than volunteers do, which raises questions about pedagogical workers' conception of education.

AB Background: Attrition or losses from the health workforce exacerbate critical shortages of health workers and can be a barrier to countries reaching their universal health coverage and equity goals. Despite the importance of accurate estimates of the attrition rate (and in particular the voluntary attrition rate) to conduct effective workforce planning, there is a dearth of an agreed definition, information and studies on this topic.
   Methods: We conducted a rapid review of studies published since 2005 on attrition rates of health workers from the workforce in different regions and settings; 1782 studies were identified, of which 51 were included in the study. In addition, we analysed data from the State of the World's Midwifery (SoWMy) 2014 survey and associated regional survey for the Arab states on the annual voluntary attrition rate for sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn health workers (mainly midwives, doctors and nurses) in the 79 participating countries.
   Results: There is a diversity of definitions of attrition and barely any studies distinguish between total and voluntary attrition (i.e. choosing to leave the workforce). Attrition rate estimates were provided for different periods of time, ranging from 3 months to 12 years, using different calculations and data collection systems. Overall, the total annual attrition rate varied between 3 and 44% while the voluntary annual attrition rate varied between 0.3 to 28%. In the SoWMy analysis, 49 countries provided some data on voluntary attrition rates of their SRMNH cadres. The average annual voluntary attrition rate was 6.8% across all cadres.
   Conclusion: Attrition, and particularly voluntary attrition, is under-recorded and understudied. The lack of internationally comparable definitions and guidelines for measuring attrition from the health workforce makes it very difficult for countries to identify the main causes of attrition and to develop and test strategies for reducing it. Standardized definitions and methods of measuring attrition are required.

AB Context: Findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that addressing persistent health disparities based on race and ethnicity must become a national priority. The field of cultural and linguistic competency has gained national attention by improving access to and quality of health care, patient-provider communication, health outcomes, and health equity for minority groups and other vulnerable or special needs populations. Objectives: (1) To measure how local health departments (LHDs) in Kentucky comply with the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS); and (2) to provide policy recommendation based on the findings. This study is the first to assess a statewide public health system under the lens of CLAS. Design: Analysis of cross-sectional survey. Setting: Electronic surveys administered to LHD administrators in Kentucky. Participants: Public health directors, nurse leaders, and program managers. Main Outcome Measure: Levels of compliance with various CLAS standards were examined for rural and urban counties using a novel scoring method. Results: A total of 159 LHD administrators received the survey. Response rate was 67% (106 participants). Rural and urban LHDs achieved moderate compliance on domains of plans and policies, quality monitoring and improvement for needs assessment, management information systems for clients, and staff training and development. Both geographic groups exhibited lesser compliance on domains of organizational governance, culturally inclusive health care environment for educational materials, and diversity of personnel recruitment. Conclusion: County and district LHDs in Kentucky have implemented activities and policies that comply with CLAS standards at levels that vary by domain. Areas requiring particular attention include organizational governance, culturally inclusive health care environment for educational materials, and diversity of personnel. Improvements in these areas may help LHDs better meet the needs of vulnerable populations, racial and ethnic minorities, and special needs groups. CLAS practices may allow organizations to adhere to national public health accreditation standards.

AB Objective: Access to services and workforce shortages are major challenges in rural areas worldwide. In order to improve access to mental health care, it is imperative to understand what services are available, what their capacity is and where existing funds might be spent to increase availability and accessibility. The aim of this study is to investigate mental health service provision in a selection of rural and remote areas across Australia by analysing service availability, placement capacity and diversity. Method: This research studies the health regions of Western New South Wales and Country Western Australia and their nine health areas. Service provision was analysed using the DESDE-LTC system for long-term care service description and classification that allows international comparison. Rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated to compare the care availability and placement capacity for children and adolescents, adults and older adults. Results: The lowest diversity was found in northern Western Australia. Overall, Western New South Wales had a higher availability of non-acute outpatient services for adults, but hardly any acute outpatient services. In Country Western Australia, substantially fewer non-acute outpatient services were found, while acute services were much more common. Acute inpatient care services were more common in Western New South Wales, while sub-acute inpatient services and non-acute day care services were only found in Western New South Wales. Conclusion: The number and span of services in the two regions showed discrepancies both within and between regions, raising issues on the equity of access to mental health care in Australia. The standard description of the local pattern of rural mental health care and its comparison across jurisdictions is critical for evidence-informed policy planning and resource allocation.

   CONSEQUENCES; SCHOOLS; JUSTICE; RACE; EXPOSURE
AB Background/Context: The issue of how to achieve a racially diverse student population has become increasingly challenging since a 2007 U. S. Supreme Court split decision endorsed the importance of creating diverse schools, while simultaneously limiting the assignment to public schools based on an individual student's race or ethnicity. The article examines innovative efforts at achieving racial integration in Berkeley, California, as well as other district efforts in New York City, to curtail the dangers associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in school building materials and develop plans to remediate contaminated school buildings.
   Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: In this article, the author draws on the disciplines of environmental sociology, critical race theory, and social epidemiology to examine the relationship between school desegregation, environmental inequality, structural racialization, and health and educational outcomes. The author proposes a conceptual framework for linking environmental health to educational outcomes that considers the dynamic social processes through which social and environmental inequalities-and associated health and educational disparities-are produced, reproduced, and transformed.
   Setting: Berkeley Unified School District has achieved substantial integration in a city where neighborhoods are polarized by racial-ethnic, socioeconomic status, and environmental inequality. Moreover, the Berkeley integration plan was upheld in 2009 by the state appellate court, a decision that the California Supreme Court allowed to stand. As a result, the Berkeley Unified School District's plan to maintain diversity could serve as a national model for other public schools that are seeking constitutionally sound desegregation programs.
   Research Design: Using empirical evidence from the published literature, as well as the author's own practical experience conducting community-based participatory research in Berkeley, the author applies the eco-apartheid conceptual framework to the city of Berkeley.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: The eco-apartheid framework provides a useful model for theory building in the study of environmental health and educational equity. Moreover, the author recommends that theories of racial and educational inequality in general would benefit from a more serious consideration of the role that environmental inequalities play in structuring the relationship between health and educational inequality. Additionally, the author highlights the ways in which existing research on desegregation remains in need of theoretical strength and methodological rigor with respect to environmental inequality.

AB This article investigates the causal factors underlying cornerstone investor (CI) participation in initial public offerings in China's offshore Hong Kong market. Prospectus-based declarations on such allocations suggest that CI undertakings offer strong certification effects. Entrepreneurs planning for IPO thus have a material incentive to court CIs. The present analysis reveals that a firm's pre-IPO financials and governance attributes strongly correlate with success in this field. Specifically, CI participation is greater in issuers with established long-term loan positions. Firms housing younger CEOs and a greater number of family-connected board officers also generate more CI interest. In contrast, the fraction of independent directors and women on boards exert minimal effect. However, further analysis reveals that greater independent director presence strongly supports CI participation in family-centric entities, but imparts little to no effect on such investment in either state-run or non-family-controlled private issuers. Additionally, an issuer's political connections galvanize CI participation. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of family resources (in non-state sponsored entities) and political connections (in state-held firms) in drawing-in CI involvement. Given the spread of CI arrangements to other primary market settings, the present enterprise also offers guidance on anchor investment elsewhere.

AB The geographical location of residents and the distribution of points of interest (POI) are key factors affecting the spatial value of urban waterfronts. This study designed an association scheme based on tourists' geographical location information (obtained from social networks) and the distribution of facilities around lakes to evaluate the spatial value of urban waterfronts. Accordingly, it explored the causes of the current condition of the waterfronts. Using the distribution status of eight types of facilities, a multivariate regression model was established to predict the number of tourists that the lakes attract. Predicted results were compared with the actual condition. The clustering degree of various POI in the waterfronts was graded by using the kernel density estimation, and the difference between the predicted results and actual value was analyzed to reveal the current condition of the urban waterfronts and the reasons for their formation. On the basis of this survey, the situation of 21 major lakes within the third ring road in Wuhan, China was investigated. Results show that existing waterfronts in some areas have a considerable number of users, but the facilities fail to meet their needs. Thus, Wuhan city's waterfront space needs to be used more effectively. This study can help with making targeted recommendations with reference to future city waterfront planning.

ID FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
AB In 2015, the Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) created the Mid-Career Leadership Institute. The initial model that motivated the creation of the institute came from my participation in the Hedwig van Ameringen Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine (ELAM) program, specifically designed to enhance the leadership skills of senior female faculty in the health sciences. My participation in ELAM was transformative. It led me to run for president of SBM in 2014, to consider how behavioral scientists could similarly benefit from mid-career leadership training, and ultimately to work with the SBM Executive Director, the SBM Leadership Institute Steering Committee, and leadership training professionals to launch the Leadership Institute in 2016. The overarching goal of the SBM Leadership Institute is to train mid-career behavioral scientists engaged in academic and health care settings to develop essential skills needed to navigate the unique challenges of mid-career. Central to this goal is a focus on integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into their emerging leadership roles through participation in training exercises, lectures, and dynamic group discussions. To optimize the Leadership Institute experience, opportunities were developed, including mentoring from SBM seasoned members, peer mentoring through the creation of "learning communities," career coaching, and additional networking opportunities. The purpose of this brief commentary is to summarize lessons learned by highlighting program evaluation, describing key changes over the initial 4 years, and sharing future plans for leadership training.

ID ATLAS
AB Australia has a population of around 4 million people aged 65 years and over, many of whom are at risk of developing cognitive decline, mental illness, and/or psychological problems associated with physical illnesses. The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of specialised mental healthcare provision (availability, placement capacity, balance of care and diversity) for this age group in urban and rural health districts in Australia. The Description and Evaluation of Services and DirectoriEs for Long Term Care (DESDE-LTC) tool was used in nine urban and two rural health districts of the thirty-one Primary Health Networks across Australia. For the most part service provision was limited to hospital and outpatient care across all study areas. The latter was mainly restricted to health-related outpatient care, and there was a relative lack of social outpatient care. While both acute and non-acute hospital care were available in urban areas, in rural areas hospital care was limited to acute care. Limited access to comprehensive mental health care, and the uniformity in provision across areas in spite of differences in demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics raises issues of equity in regard to psychogeriatric care in this country. Comparing patterns of mental health service provision across the age span using the same classification method allows for a better understanding of care provision and gap analysis for evidence-informed policy.

DE Trainee teachers; ethnicity; cultural discriminations; interculturality;
   social inclusion
AB Despite a growing human and economic development [1], the Mauritian society is marked by discriminations that hinder equity opportunities for personal development of members of different communities. Our doctoral research aimed at contributing to the promotion of diversity in the school field, by analyzing and better understanding representations and attitudes of future primary school teachers about the ethnocultural diversity of their society, the cohabitation of different communities and the role of cultural factors in educational pathways. We tried to assess the possibility for them of taking into account the multiculturalism of pupils' population in their teaching practices, and how they would plan to do it. The socio-political context fosters the maintenance of cultural differences and specific community identities that remain opportunities of international economic exchanges. "Communalism", "diseases" and "community complexes" are source of mistrust and difficult contacts with other cultures; the different identities are not yet experienced by Mauritians as strengthened [2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]. In this context, the educational system, through its competitive functioning, confirms and reproduces these cultural based inequalities [8; 9]. The recognition of cultural difference is a long and complex psychosocial developmental process [10; 11]. Teacher's vocational training, if it is ambitious and realistic, could be an important help to promote intercultural dialogue and therefore more equitable human development. Understanding and description of mutual stereotypes and prejudices, such as representations that teachers have of their job, are necessary for the implementation of an efficient intercultural education policy. In a changing societal context, religion seems to become the main identity factor for the Mauritians. Respectful tolerance of others, but also relational distance, especially between teachers and students, are consequences of this cultural identification. It appears essential to take into account these social transformations and divergent feelings of cultural belonging. The Mauritian interculturality seems to be moving towards a double construction where a religious community membership and a common national citizenship coexist. This citizenship can bring people together but stay emptied of valuable cultural content. The development of a truly recognized common culture seems utopian. The Mauritius Institute of Education is currently working on the preparation of an "intercultural training" program for its students. The contributions of our research, by communicating its findings and recommendations to heads of the institution, could promote efficiency of such training.

AB Rationale/Purpose: The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has taken gender equality(1) 1 According to the International Labour Organization (2018), gender equality refers to equal allocation of rights, responsibilities, benefits, resources, and opportunities that all people are treated in the same way while gender quality can be understood in diverse ways in sport (Shaw & Frisby, 2006). For example, girls and women are regarded the same as boys and men; in turn, they should be treated equally. On another note, gender equity indicates fair treatments for women and men based on their respective needs. In most instances, gender equity might not include equality to practices using a liberal feminist perspective, but perceptions of fairness. As such, gender equity is considered equivalent treatment in terms of the allocation of rights and resources. Despite its important distinction between these two concepts gender equality and gender equity, however, the meanings are not clearly articulated in practice and thus lead to complex understandings of the terms. In this paper, we question the institutionalized gender inequality. Here we do not mean that women and men leaders to become the same, but the resource allocation. initiatives by inaugurating a female leadership development programme (FLDP)(2) 2 FIFA's gender initiatives in leadership can be traced back to their appointment of the first woman in the history of FIFA, Lydia Nsekera, to its 25-member executive committee in 2013. Ever since then, FIFA elected three women, including Lydia Nsekera, to the executive committees, and Moya Dodd, one of these members, committed herself to put extensive efforts to improve gender balance in football. As a result, FIFA formed a task force, chaired by Moya Dodd, to identify key areas and create detailed plans for women's football during the presidency of Sepp Blatter in 2014. As part of the efforts carried out by the task force, FIFA launched a nine-month female leadership development programme (FLDP) in May 2015. The FLDP aims to enhance gender diversity and inclusive decision-making practices while increasing the number of women leaders. In doing so, FIFA can convert such diversity initiatives into tangible benefits for women's football and eventually change leadership dynamics in football. After implementing the first edition of the FLDP, FIFA appointed two women in the positions of secretary-general and chief women's football in 2016. Because Moya Dodd and few colleagues from inside and outside FIFA have done a great deal of work to promote equitable leadership opportunities for women in football, FIFA has held a series of annual conferences and workshops for the development of women's football, as well as support for women in football governance. as well as appointing women(3) 3 While the terms sex and gender are often used interchangeably, there are distinctions between sex and gender. According to Powell (2018), sex is related to anatomical structure, referring to one's biological categories and physical characteristics that, in most cases, define female and male, as well as living organisms. The term gender, which has generally been used as a synonym for sex for the past decades, is related to an imposed sociocultural and psychological conditions for the biological categories of sex. The discourses surrounding gender is particularly associated with the socially constructed roles, attitudes, and behaviors of and between groups of men and women.
   For example, participation in sport and physical activities is perceived as inappropriate for girls and women and includes few activities such as dancing and gymnastics viewed as primarily for girls and women, if at all (Cunningham, 2019). As such, gender stereotypes and roles are closely associated with a particular sex and sport-with being masculine, feminine, or neutral (Burton et al., 2009). More recently, researchers have expanded the definition of gender and sex beyond the binary, arguing that gender can be fluid and multifaceted (Halberstam, 2012). In this case, people can challenge the restrictive views of gender to express diverse social meanings and expectations. While we recognize that gender can be seen as a spectrum, in this article, we indicate the term gender as the idea of how boys and girls or men and women are expected to behave at work. In doing so, we are able to discuss traditional gender role expectations associated with those behaviors adopted overtly or covertly by societal conditions. in leadership positions. As such, we draw from a new theoretical notion, glass cliff to explore why FIFA started FLDP and assigned women to leadership ranks. Methodology/Approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 women who accomplished FLDP.

ID CONVENTION; INFORMATION
AB Societal Impact Statement The Fourth Industrial Revolution is underway. Controversy surrounds the choice of modality for access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization, as established in the third objective of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The modality chosen by the Conference of the Parties should promote conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources, which are the first and second objectives of the convention. "Bounded openness over natural information" achieves all three objectives by aligning incentives between users and Providers. With philanthropic support, the modality can also be applied to unpublished traditional knowledge, which would enhance food security. Several international agreements have provisions for "access to genetic resources" and "fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from [their] utilization" (ABS). The optimal modality has proven elusive for the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Nagoya Protocol (NP). Such failure need not be so. We embrace reductionism and partition genetic resources into tangible and intangible attributes and classify the latter as natural or artificial information. The economics of information justifies "rents," which is the difference between what is paid and what would have been paid in a competitive market. Fairness and equity imply protection for natural information equal to that of artificial information. Bilateralism eliminates rents through competition and renders royalties infinitesimal, thus defeating ABS. The proposed Global Multilateral Benefit-Sharing Mechanism (GMBSM) could capture rents and distribute royalty income proportional to habitat for terrestrial species, and to CO2 reductions for marine species and wild relatives of crops. Alignment of incentives for conservation would facilitate transition to half-Earth. Domesticated species require stronger incentives for conservation than do nondomesticated species. The Multilateral System (MLS) of The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) should be expanded. Enclosure of traditional knowledge not yet in public domain through a benefit-sharing mechanism could incentivize communities to deposit samples into the CGIAR Genebanks and resume seed exchange, which is essential for food security. A robust modality of ABS for the CBD, NP, ITPGRFA and other agreements is "bounded openness."

DT Article
ID RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT; HEALTH-CARE; DIVERSITY; RACE; MODEL
AB Self-reflection in multicultural education is an important means to develop self-awareness and ultimately to change professional behavior in favor of more equitable health care to diverse populations. As conceptualized by scholars in the field of psychology, racial identity theory is critical to understanding and planning for the potentially wide range of predictable reactions to provocative activities, including those negative reactions that do not necessarily herald a flaw in programming. Careful consideration of racial identity developmental phases can also assist program planners to optimally meet the needs of individual physician trainees in their ongoing constructive professional and personal development, and in strategically mobilizing and having ready the type of institutional leadership that supports trainees' change processes.
   The authors focus on white physician trainees, the largest racial group of U.S. physicians and medical students. They first explain what they mean by the terms white and nonwhite. Racial identity theory is then applied, with true case examples, to explore such issues as where the self-proclaimed "color-blind" trainee fits into this theoretical schema, and how medical educators can best serve trainees who are resistant or indifferent to discussions of racism in medicine and equity in health care delivery. Ultimately, the authors' goal is to demonstrate that engendering genuine self-reflection can substantively improve the delivery of health care to the nation's diverse population. To help achieve that goal, they emphasize what to anticipate in effecting optimal trainee education and how to create an institutional climate supportive of individual change.

AB Access to health care based on need rather than ability to pay was the founding principle of the Canadian health-care system. Medicare was born in one province in 1947. It spread across the country through federal cost sharing, and eventually was harmonised through standards in a federal law, the Canada Health Act of 1984. The health-care system is less a true national system than a decentralised collection of provincial and territorial insurance plans covering a narrow basket of services, which are free at the point of care. Administration and service delivery are highly decentralised, although coverage is portable across the country. In the setting of geographical and population diversity, long waits for elective care demand the capacity and commitment to scale up effective and sustainable models of care delivery across the country. Profound health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations and some vulnerable groups also require coordinated action on the social determinants of health if these inequities are to be effectively addressed. Achievement of the high aspirations of Medicare's founders requires a renewal of the tripartite social contract between governments, health-care providers, and the public. Expansion of the publicly funded basket of services and coordinated effort to reduce variation in outcomes will hinge on more engaged roles for the federal government and the physician community than have existed in previous decades. Public engagement in system stewardship will also be crucial to achieve a high-quality system grounded in both evidence and the Canadian values of equity and solidarity.

TI Shifting the Curve: Fostering Academic Success in a Diverse Student Body
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE

DT Editorial Material
ID PREDICTIVE-VALIDITY; MEDICAL-SCHOOL; PERFORMANCE; MCAT
AB Problem
   Diversity in the health care workforce is key to achieving health equity. Although U.S. medical schools have worked to increase the matriculation and academic success of underrepresented minority (URM) students (African Americans, Latinos, others), they have had only limited success. Lower standardized test scores, including on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), have been a barrier to matriculation for many URM applicants. Lower subsequent standardized exam scores, including on the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1, also have been an impediment to students' progress, with mean scores for URM students lagging behind those for others.
   Approach
   Faculty at the Morehouse School of Medicine developed and implemented interventions to enhance the academic success of their URM students (about 75% are African American, and 5% are from other URM groups). To assess the outcomes of this work, the authors analyzed the MCAT scores and subsequent Step 1 scores of students in the graduating classes of 2009-2014. They also reviewed course evaluations, Graduation Questionnaires, and student and faculty interviews and focus groups.
   Outcomes
   Students' Step 1 scores exceeded those expected based on their MCAT scores. This success was due to three key elements: (1) milieu and mentoring, (2) structure and content of the curriculum, and (3) monitoring.
   Next Steps
   A series of mixed-method studies are planned to better discern the core elements of faculty-student relationships that are key to students' success. Lower test scores are not a fixed attribute; with the elements described, success is attainable for all students.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify factors influencing female medical students' decision-making about specialties, specifically surgery and interventional radiology (IR), in an effort to inform future recruitment and professional development strategies.
   DESIGN: An electronic survey was created to assess both qualitative and quantitative data.
   SETTING: The survey was sent prior to a symposium for trainees interested in pursuing IR or surgery, held at University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) in February 2019.
   PARTICIPANTS: The 90 female trainees who registered were sent the survey, and 48 (53%) responded voluntarily.
   RESULTS: All respondents were female, 46% planned to pursue surgery or IR. Students pursuing surgery/IR were less concerned about being valued by their colleagues (p = 0.0073), being in charge of patients' lives (p = 0.0017), radiation exposure (p = 0.0171), chemical exposure (p = 0.0223), emotional stress (p = 0.0244), or shift work (p = 0.0045), compared to the nonsurgery/IR students. No differences were found in ranking of motivating factors, personal strengths or weaknesses, deciding factors, areas for seeking mentorship, or gender diversity. Top motivations among all respondents were intellectual rigor of medicine and becoming a mentor, while concerns were personal physical health, managing a career, pay equity, and gender-based biases. Students most often sought mentors and clerkship experience for making specialty decisions. They reported greatest strengths in empathy and resilience, and weaknesses in negotiating and public speaking.
   CONCLUSIONS: Female medical students planning to pursue surgery/IR expressed greater confidence in their contributions to patient care and lower concerns about workplace hazards. Regardless of specialty intent, female students shared scholarship motivations for a career in medicine, valued the role of mentorship, and expressed persistent concerns about gender discrimination, personal health, and skills-based weaknesses. Identifying factors influential in career decision-making is important in order to recruit and retain a more gender-diverse physician workforce. (C) 2020 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

AB Questions of equity, justice, and fairness in the international agricultural adaptation regime have emerged in recent years, prompting interest in regime power dynamics. Here, a three-dimensional conceptual framework of 'power as domination' is applied to the UNFCCC adaptation regime. We argue that this 'power-over' framing is an important lens through which to view adaptation, a field dominated by 'power-to', capacity-based constructs. The framework distinguishes between power-over manifesting through decision-making, agenda setting and preference shaping. Through a literature review we demonstrate that first and second dimension behavioral views of power-over fail to account for the subtle ways in which the interests and preferences of smallholder farmers are unknowingly shaped and restricted within the regime. Potential sources of third dimension preference shaping power are explored in a survey with high-level decision makers involved in National Adaptation Plans (NAP) development in seven countries. The results suggest that several inter-related features of the international agriculture adaptation regime collectively contribute to the shaping of interests and preferences of smallholders: prevailing discourses of uncertainty and the perceived limited capacity of smallholders; the resulting privileged status of 'expert' decision makers; the predominance of neoliberal development rationalities; and systemic biases resulting from the nation state as the principle unit of UNFCCC negotiation. These forces lie beyond the explanatory scope of first and second dimensions of power-over and help to explain why stakeholder engagement in adaptation decision making remains superficial in nature and why adaptation responses in agriculture can be considered 'common and non-differentiated'. We argue for increased awareness of third dimension manifestations and impacts of power in adaptation literature to facilitate the improved participation of marginalized stakeholders in UNFCCC and domestic adaptation decision making forums, to increase the diversity of adaptation options available to smallholders, and ultimately, to improve the attribution of responsibility for adaptation outcomes.

ID STUDENTS
AB Using a phenomenographic design, this research reports on a study of a cohort (N=22) of graduate students' conceptualizations of difference as they progressed through the only required diversity course in a science education program at a large, urban university in the American northeast. Data collection included biweekly course reflections, a modified Pedagogy of Science Teaching Test designed with students labeled with disabilities within its contextual framing, and biweekly science for all' lessons created by the participants that were not explicitly framed to address disability. Mixed-methods data analyses addressed to what extent these graduate students developed a critical lens toward difference (i.e., expressed, imagined, and/or imposed variations in human behavior and potential) and explored to what extent these theoretical elements transferred into pragmatic applications by the participants, for example in their lesson planning, that addressed multiple interpretations of difference to provide evidence of their capabilities to bridge theory to practice. Additionally, the case of disability as a marker of difference was also paid special attention to in light of lacking analyses in multicultural science education around issues of disability exclusion and teacher biases toward this marker of difference. The data suggest that while students in this urban and multicultural science education' course appear to be able to theorize critically about multicultural issues in urban science education (as per the goal of the course), their capacities to reflect on their pedagogical decisions within contexts that contain students labeled with disabilities, and plan comprehensive science for all' classroom learning environments, remained disciplinary focused, no matter if the students labeled with disabilities were the focal marker of difference within these contexts' demographics or not. Emergent data analysis also suggests that disability was the least recognized and interpreted marker of difference, which led to limited ways that students took up this concept in comparison with other forms of difference such as race, class, and gender. Moreover, rather than emphasizing critical pedagogies that are pertinent for transformative change in science education for all diverse populations, the participants remained focused on narrowly defined, content-specific ways of teaching and learning science. Implications for this research include focusing on the goals of courses such as this one, attending to the unique case of disability as a liminal realm of conceptualizing difference, and supporting graduate students' needs to aid in bridging the divide between theory and practice for both more traditional markers of difference taken up by multicultural science education (e.g., race, class, and gender) as well as disability as a marker of difference that is under theorized and lacking pragmatic application within such diversity requirement courses.

AB Background: Environmental nuisances, including ambient air pollution, are thought to contribute to social inequalities in health. There are two major mechanisms, which may act independently or synergistically, through which air pollution may play this role. Disadvantaged groups are recognized as being more often exposed to air pollution (differential exposure) and may also be more susceptible to the resultant health effects (differential susceptibility). Method: European research articles were obtained through a literature search in the Medline database using keywords 'Socioeconomic Factors, Air Pollution, Health' and synonymous expressions. Results: Some studies found that poorer people were more exposed to air pollution whereas the reverse was observed in other papers. A general pattern, however, is that, irrespective of exposure, subjects of low socio-economic status experience greater health effects of air pollution. So far as we are aware, no European study has explored this relationship among children. Conclusion: The housing market biases land use decisions and may explain why some subgroups suffer from both a low socio-economic status and high exposure to air pollution. Some data may be based on inaccurate exposure assessment. Cumulative exposures should be taken into account to explore health problems more accurately. The issue of exposure and health inequalities in relation to ambient air quality is complex and calls for global appraisal. There is no single pattern. Policies aimed at reducing the root causes of these inequalities could be based on urban multipolarity and diversity, two attributes that require long-term urban planning.

AB This paper focuses on the Black minority ethnic population (Black British, Black African, Black Caribbean) and uses the term BME in reference to this group. Only 6.2% of BME people access psychological intervention for common mental disorders. In provision of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) the diversity in global majority populations(1) requires culturally specific informed and responsive approaches. The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme needs to be accountable, culturally congruent and strategic, to ensure accessibility and improve outcomes for BME people. According to the Mental Health Foundation (2019), a higher percentage of Black, Asian and other minority ethnic populations (BAME) are diagnosed with common, severe and complex mental health disorders. Despite the weight of literature on this, little has changed. The NHS Implementation Plan outlines trajectories for increased access and reduced attrition within mental health services, addressing inequalities for BAME populations.
   Evidence-based guidance and audits for provision of culturally sensitive and adapted therapies are presented in the pioneering (IAPT) BAME Positive Practice Guide (PPG). However, there are no funding arrangements or formal integrated frameworks to support implementation. The COVID-19 global pandemic and the high-profile death of George Floyd tragically exposed and highlighted the consequences of systemic racism. Understanding of the importance of service and clinical anti-racist practice is imperative for CBT therapists. Implementation of the BAME PPG audit tool ensures review of race equity in access, engagement, adaptation and workforce within IAPT and other mental health services. This could transform lives.

ID MISSING DATA; PARTICIPATION
AB In Australia, under the National Assessment Plan, educational accountability testing in literacy and numeracy (NAPLAN) is undertaken with all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 to monitor student achievement and inform policy. However, the extent to which these data have been analysed to report student progress is limited. This article reports a study analysing Year-3 and Year-5 NAPLAN reading and numeracy data, school and student information for a single student cohort from Queensland, Australia, to examine student achievement and progress. The analyses use longitudinal multilevel modelling, incorporating an enhanced approach for missing data imputation, given that such data frequently involve large amounts of missing data and failure to account properly for such missing data may bias interpretations of analyses. Further, statistical adjustments to deal with the impact of measurement error, an aspect not previously addressed in such analyses of data, are undertaken. A special focus of analyses is achievement of Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. International and national data demonstrate a considerable achievement gap between these students. "Closing the gap" is a core Australian education equity policy, with NAPLAN data used as a primary indicator of policy impact. Overall, analyses indicate greater understanding of student progress for all students is available from Australian data if appropriate analyses are undertaken. However, analyses also demonstrate not only that the gap between Australian Indigenous and non-Indigenous student progress increases as they move through school but also diversity of achievement within the Indigenous student cohort. Implications for policy are considered.

AB Purpose: This paper seeks to provide an insight into networking practices aiming at identifying how a network of schools, teachers, principals, researchers, academic institutions and policy makers will be able to form learning networks in order to encourage teachers and principals continuing professional development. The second aim focuses on how the connection of theory and practice shapes practices of action collaborative research, encouraging participation in decision making processes and formulating policies in Greek schools with diverse student population.
   Design/methodology/approach: This article is one of the very first papers on networking practices in the Greek context with the methodology adopted to be a literature approach focusing on the one hand on the educational change theories the relationships and the culture issues as they operate and are formulated within DiapolisNet; and on the other hand on the leadership and the issues of equity and diversity among the members of the DiapolisNet. A literature approach was followed where the DiapolisNet was examined both at its micro and its macro scales and levels.
   Findings: This paper argues that school networks are becoming an important method to expand the learning continuum of all the involved persons in the network by empowering teachers and principals to facilitate their professional development and to enhance student achievement and improve the education provided.
   Originality/value: The paper offers insights into the implications for helping repatriated and foreign students to be educated like native students and improving the provided education of the Greek schools for all students in general through teachers' continuing professional development as well as the empowerment of all the partner schools and other external bodies.

AB Background The need for cross-sector collaborations to implement system-level improvements in early childhood care and education brings increased demand for comprehensive and practicable means of evaluating such collaborations. Objective This mixed-methods study evaluates a statewide collaboration formed to develop a strategic plan for a comprehensive mixed-delivery system serving children birth to age 5 using instruments appropriate to an early-stage collaboration and adding a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Method All collaboration members were asked to complete the Collaborative Vitality Survey and a random subsample of members with high rates of participation completed phone interviews. Survey data were summarized across six dimensions: participation, community, productivity, communication, accountability, and synergy. Using thematic analysis and frequencies, qualitative interviews were coded along these dimensions and DEI, incorporating an appreciative inquiry approach identifying barriers, supports, and hopes for the future. Results Overall, collaborative participation was high. Across methods, respondents reported they, overall, were pleased with collaborative functioning. Qualitative interviews suggest the collaboration domains of community and participation were most salient. Concrete recommendations from participants can be put into practice and inform the collaboration as state-level work continues. Conclusion The early stage of collaboration is fundamental to success and defined by building cohesion, norms, and roles. This study highlights key weaknesses and strengths that influence collaborative functioning at this stage and illustrates the significance of defining and manifesting DEI in collaboration efficacy. This study demonstrates the importance of evaluating collaboration in an ongoing manner to ensure effectiveness and inform improvements in functioning over time.

ID PHYSICAL-EDUCATION; INTERGROUP CONTACT; SPORT; ATTITUDES; DISABILITIES;
   INCLUSION
AB In a world of increasing diversity in which many established democracies are now consumed by capitalist individualism and protectionist ideals, a focus on equity and social justice is particularly pertinent. For many years, scholars have proposed that schools have the educational responsibility to prepare children for peaceful living in a heterogeneous society and claimed that health and physical education (HPE) activities at school can enhance interpersonal relations, and social cohesion. This paper explores the definition of social cohesion, as well as theories that support its inclusion in school practices before drawing on observational and interview data from of an international project that reveal how HPE teachers across three different countries teach for social cohesion. In our analysis of the data, we employ Allport's 'Contact Theory' (1954) and Pettigrew's (1998) extension of this theory to conceptualise and interpret the teaching for social cohesion in HPE practice. Within the overarching theme of teaching for social cohesion we present and discuss five sub-themes as examples of the teachers' pedagogies: (1) a focus on inclusiveness; (2) the inclusion of culturally inclusive practices; (3) building teacher/student and student/student relationships; (4) planning and structuring activities for students to work together in heterogeneous teams while focusing on cooperation; and (5) focusing on personal and social responsibility by encouraging adherence to the principles of fair play and democratically determined rules. We conclude by stating that HPE should be recognised for its role in creating opportunities for constructive social interaction between students of difference, which can contribute to greater inclusion, social cohesion and ultimately social justice in society.

ID PERCEPTIONS
AB For decades, research summarizing educational outcomes has indicated significant disparities, which continue to impact the academic achievement and wellbeing of Black students in Ontario. These concerns are further amplified due to the lack of disaggregated educational data, making it difficult to outline and address disparities for specific groups of Black students, such as Black girls. Equity and inclusion policies implemented by the Ontario government focus on meeting the needs of Black students; however, reviewing provincial educational plans reveals a failure to explicitly account for intersectionality in Black students and as result, the nuanced needs of specific Black students, particularly Black girls, are ignored. This article uses critical discourse analysis combined with tenets of Black feminist epistemologies to contextualize first-hand accounts of the school experiences of 11 Black girls living in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The qualitative data, collected for a larger study, exposes harmful learning environments, which include incessant teacher microaggressions and differential treatment practices that Black girls regularly experience in GTA schools. In spite of popular contemporary themes such as #Blackgirlmagic, used to uplift and empower Black girls in adverse circumstances, it is important to acknowledge that Black girls are not inherently magical and therefore, cannot individually resolve the larger systemic educational issues which impact them. In the end, if efforts to address educational inequities through policies and practices are meant to resolve disparities for all Black students in Ontario, the impact of intersectionality demands that the barriers experienced by Black girls in school receive immediate careful consideration.

AB Introduction: The hidden curriculum encompasses the norms, values, and behaviors within a learning environment. Navigating the hidden curricula of academia is crucial for doctoral trainees, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. Faculty mentors have an important role in helping trainees uncover and cope with the hidden curriculum. The purpose of this paper is to explore perceptions of the hidden curriculum among diverse doctoral trainees and mentors. Methods: Following a presentation on the hidden curriculum at the Association for Clinical and Translational Science annual meeting in March 2021, attendees were asked to brainstorm ideas for diverse trainees and their mentors. Breakout room discussions were held for specific hidden curriculum topics; participants voted on which topics to discuss from a list of topics defined during the presentation. Ideas from these discussions were presented to the larger group to upvote. Results: Participants (n = 116) voted to discuss the following hidden curriculum topics: "coping with bias," "assertive communication," "knowing how things work," and "developing a career." Many suggestions emphasized the role of institutions in empowering mentors to help diverse trainees and, more generally, to meaningfully support policies and programs that facilitate the career success of trainees and faculty from underrepresented backgrounds. Conclusions: This work generated a list of suggested action items for trainees, mentors, and institutions to ameliorate the hidden curricula of academia, especially for diverse trainees. However, institutions need to support changes that will facilitate these discussions as well as more broadly enable the success of faculty and students from diverse backgrounds.

ID IMPACT; FRAMEWORKS
AB Background: The monitoring and evaluation of health research capacity strengthening (health RCS) commonly involves documenting activities and outputs using indicators or metrics. We sought to catalogue the types of indicators being used to evaluate health RCS and to assess potential gaps in quality and coverage.
   Methods: We purposively selected twelve evaluations to maximize diversity in health RCS, funders, countries, and approaches to evaluation. We explored the quality of the indicators and extracted them into a matrix across individual, institutional, and national/regional/network levels, based on a matrix in the ESSENCE Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation framework. We synthesized across potential impact pathways (activities to outputs to outcomes) and iteratively checked our findings with key health RCS evaluation stakeholders.
   Results: Evaluations varied remarkably in the strengths of their evaluation designs. The validity of indicators and potential biases were documented in a minority of reports. Indicators were primarily of activities, outputs, or outcomes, with little on their inter-relationships. Individual level indicators tended to be more quantitative, comparable, and attentive to equity considerations. Institutional and national-international level indicators were extremely diverse. Although linkage of activities through outputs to outcomes within evaluations was limited, across the evaluations we were able to construct potential pathways of change and assemble corresponding indicators.
   Conclusions: Opportunities for improving health RCS evaluations include work on indicator measurement properties and development of indicators which better encompass relationships with knowledge users. Greater attention to evaluation design, prospective indicator measurement, and systematic linkage of indicators in keeping with theories of change could provide more robust evidence on outcomes of health RCS.

AB The study of Ecosystem services (ES) is a prolific field of research. Despite the great biological and cultural diversity, in Latin America, research in this field has been growing at a much slower rate than in the rest of the world. The study of ES is called upon to contribute to informed decision-making for the planning and conservation of the territory and to improve well-being. However, this can only be achieved if the various stakeholders' vision about their environment is considered, since they are the ones most impacted by such decisions. Our study was carried out in nine rural communities in three municipalities in central and northern Nicaragua, a rural country with high rates of rural poverty. We questioned the perceptions of rural land uses as providers of ES by rural communities, from a gender perspective. We addressed this question from the framework of the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) that allowed us to interrelate such diverse topics as the study of ES, gender and land uses. In each community, we first requested the endorsement of the community leaders, and then we carried out semi-structured interviews and separate focus groups for men and women. We used participatory mapping and the pebble distribution method (PDM), to identify how gender identity influences perceptions about benefits, location, and access to ES. Both men and women recognized the benefits of nature but differed in the identification of land uses that most provide ES. Exceptions were the forest areas, agroforestry systems and rivers, all of which were recognized as providing the greatest amount of services. These results are especially useful in the development of public policies to reduce poverty and address gender gaps in rural communities.

AB Background & objectives: Numerous studies have highlighted the regressive and immiserating impact of out-of-pocket (OOP) health spending in India. However, most of these studies have explored this issue at the national or up to the State level, with an associated risk of overlooking intra-State diversities in the health system and health-seeking behaviour and their implication on the financial burden of healthcare. This study was aimed to address this issue by analyzing district level diversities in inequity, financial burden and impoverishing impact of OOP health spending.
   Methods: A household survey of 62,335 individuals from 12,134 households, covering eight districts across three States, namely Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan was conducted during 2014-2015. Other than general household characteristics, the survey collected information on household OOP [sum total of expenditure on doctor consultation, drugs, diagnostic tests etc. on inpatient depatment (IPD), outpatient depatment (OPD) or chronic ailments] and household monthly consumption expenditure [sum total of monthly expenditure on food, clothing, education, healthcare (OOP) and others]. Gini index of consumption expenditure, concentration index and Kakwani index (KI) of progressivity of OOP, catastrophic burden (at 20% threshold) and poverty impact (using district-level poverty thresholds) were computed, for these eight districts using the survey data. The concentration curve (of OOP expenditure) and Lorenz curve (of consumption expenditure) for the eight districts were also drawn.
   Results: The distribution of OOP was found to be regressive in all the districts, with significant inter-district variations in equity parameters within a State (KI ranges from -0.062 to -0.353). Chhota Udepur, the only tribal district within the sample was found to have the most regressive distribution (KI of -0.353) of OOP. Furthermore, the economic burden of OOP was more pronounced among the rural sample (CB of 19.2% and IM of 8.9%) compared to the urban sample (CB of 9.4% and IM of 3.7%).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The results indicate that greater decentralized planning taking into account district-level health financing patterns could be an effective way to tackle inequity and financial vulnerability emerging out of OOP expenses on healthcare.

ID CLINICAL-PSYCHOLOGY
AB Canadian society has changed dramatically in the last 40 years. Significant shifts in demographics, primary economic drivers, societal norms, technology, the nature of health and health care, and sociopolitical trends have all had a marked impact on the nature of professional psychology. In addition to these changes, the landscape in which professional psychologists are trained and practice has witnessed shifting funding structures and has become increasingly crowded with other professional groups having encroached on practice areas that were once the exclusive purview of the profession. Despite these changes, professional psychology training has remained relatively static. In light of this reality, a summit on the future of professional psychology training was held in Montreal, Quebec from May 7th to 9th, 2019. Delegates represented all areas of professional psychology and nearly all regions of the country. This article describes the process by which delegates were selected and summit themes identified, as well as an overview of summit recommendations, some of which include the need to develop models of training that can meet increasing market place demand for psychologists, establishing clear definitions and guidelines for supervision that support professional training throughout one's career trajectory, a commitment to addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion, attend to the importance of technology literacy as part of training, and include formal, high-quality teaching of collaboration competencies in training. A complete list of summit recommendations is appended with the hope of encouraging continued discussion amongst the professional training community, particularly with respect to implementation of the various recommendations.
   Public Significance Statement
   Psychologists provide services to individuals, groups, communities, corporations, and governments. Their contributions have become increasingly valued and in demand by Canadians. As such, the profession has a responsibility to ensure its young professionals are trained in a manner that is attuned to the needs of Canadian society. The National Summit on the Future of Professional Psychology Training had, as its objective, crafting a set of recommendations aimed at delivering on this responsibility, which will spur further discussion within the training community

AB Objectives The CAEP 2021 2SLGBTQIA +(i) panel sought whether a gap exists within Canadian emergency medicine training pertaining to sexual and gender minority communities. This panel aimed to generate practical recommendations on improving emergency medicine education about sexual and gender minorities, thereby improving access to equitable healthcare. Methods From August 2020 to June 2021, a panel of emergency medicine practitioners, residents, students, and community representatives met monthly via videoconference. A literature review was undertaken, and three mixed methods surveys were distributed to the CAEP member list, CAEP Resident Section, College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC)(iii) Emergency Medicine Members Interest Group, and to emergency medicine residency program directors and their residents. Informed by the review and surveys, recommendations were drafted and refined by panel members before presentation at the 2021 CAEP Academic Symposium. A plenary was presented to symposium attendees composed of national emergency medicine community members, which reported the survey results and literature review. All attendees were divided into small groups to develop an action plan for each recommendation. Conclusions The panel outlines eight recommendations for closing the curricular gap. It identifies three perceived or real barriers to the inclusion of sexual and gender minority content in emergency medicine residency curricula. It acknowledges three enabling recommendations that are beyond the scope of individual emergency medicine programs or emergency departments (EDs), that if enacted would enable the implementation of the recommendations. Each recommendation is accompanied by two action items as a guide to implementation. Each of the three barriers is accompanied by two action items that offer specific solutions to overcome these obstacles. Each enabling recommendation suggests an action that would shift emergency medicine towards sociocultural competence nationally. These recommendations set the primary steps towards closing the educational gap.

TI Inclusive Education and the "Balkanization" Professionalization of the
   Specialized Field of Studies in Special Education Postgraduate Programs:
   The Case of Sweden
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This short paper has two pronged purposes. The first is to reflect on policies and practices of inclusive education in Sweden and the second is to problematize the implications of the continuous proliferation of the specialized field of studies in Special Education postgraduate programs in Sweden. The current Swedish political and educational discourses reflect contradictions and dilemmas among varied dimensions of the educational arena. Policy and practice decisions involve dilemmas. Sweden may be characterized by an embodiment of a strong philosophy of universalism, equal entitlements of citizenship, comprehensiveness, and solidarity as an instrument to promote social inclusion and equality of resources. Within the past decades, however, the country has undergone a dramatic transformation. The changes are framed within neo-liberal philosophies such as devolution, market solutions, competition, effectivity, and standardization, coupled with a proliferation of individual/parent choices for independent schools, all of which potentially work against the valuing of diversity, equity and inclusion (Berhanu, 2011, 2016). The second concern of this paper is: Does the current specialization or diversified form of studies within Special Education postgraduate programs (Teacher Training Programs) support the inclusive agenda, or does it hamper the vision? In addition, recent developments to create new categories or subcategories of special education have the potential not only to tie up administrative and diagnostic resources but also to create an increasingly less manageable array of separate special education programs. This Balkanization process with regard to a number of select disorders has advantages and disadvantages. My concern is that the very existence of "highly specialized knowledge domains" may result in a new form of exclusion and segregation. This is a scenario that one can imagine or expect with the proliferation or balkanization of specialized studies in numerous strands unless we plan carefully as to how to utilize these skills and expertise within inclusive settings.

TI "No Unfavorable Comments from Any Quarter": Teaching Black History to
   White Students in the American South, 1928-1943
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Background/Context: The history curriculum is often used to help reach the goal of racial tolerance and understanding by teaching about the nation's diversity. Many educators believe that teaching about diverse peoples in schools will bring about greater equity in society. This historical study looks at the segregated American South from 1928 to 1943 and an effort by a mixed-race voluntary organization to teach Black history in White schools.
   Focus of Study: This study examines the efforts of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC), beginning in 1928, to promote the teaching of Black history in southern segregated schools in an effort to bring about greater racial tolerance and awareness. The CIC circulated a booklet, which was a short history of African Americans titled "America's Tenth Man," and invited schools to submit essays on Black history for cash prizes. The contests ran from 1928 until 1943, when the CIC was renamed the Southern Regional Council, which reflected a change in the organization's emphasis on regional planning.
   Research Design: This is a historical examination of teaching Black history in segregated schools. The author relies on primary sources-including teachers' reports, correspondence, and students' projects-and secondary studies in the history of education and the curriculum.
   Conclusions: By challenging historians' views of the CIC-that the organization was largely ineffectual and that its Tenth Man contests did not result in any measureable improvement in race relations in the South-the author raises questions about the implementation of Black history curricula in order to influence students' behavior and attitudes about race. Likewise, the author shows how White teachers were outspoken activists for Black history in schools. The study concludes that the teaching of Black history to White students was not uniform and was ideologically diverse.

AB Objective: To evaluate the experience and perceptions of reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellowship applicants and program directors (PDs) regarding the current and future use of web-based interviews (WBIs).
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Nationwide cohort.
   Patient(s): Reproductive endocrinology and infertility fellowship applicants and PDs participating in the 2020 application cycle.
   Intervention(s): Anonymous survey sent to applicants and PDs.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Descriptive study evaluating the experience and satisfaction of applicants and PDs with WBIs.
   Result(s): Forty-six percent of applicants and eligible PDs responded to our survey. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were adequate for conveying a sense of a program's strengths, faculty, diversity, clinical training, and research opportunities, but less than half responded that WBIs were adequate in providing a sense of the program's clinical site and facilities. After WBIs, both applicants (73%) and PDs (86%) were able to rank with confidence. The cost of WBIs was significantly lower for both applicants (median: $100) and programs (median: $100) than the costs previously reported for in-person interviews. The applicants interviewed at more programs than they would have if the interviews were on-site, and Zoom was the highest rated platform used. Most applicants and PDs responded that WBIs were an adequate substitute, and that they should continue after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Furthermore, most of the PDs were planning to continue to use WBIs in some capacity.
   Conclusion(s): Both applicants and PDs had favorable experiences with and perceptions of WBIs, and most endorse the continued use of this interview modality. The findings of this study can help guide and optimize future WBI practices. ((C) 2021 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

   DECISIONS; PHYSICIAN; JUSTICE; SMOKING; POLICY
AB This Article examines the promise and limits of a moral paradigm for allocating resources both to health care and among competing health care needs, and derives the essential attributes of a moral health care system.  The author concludes that, given society's limited resources, the absolutist position that no beneficial health care should ever be denied is untenable.  Nonetheless, no health care system can survive unless it avoids ongoing tradeoffs between health needs and monetary costs by imposing a budgetary constraint derived outside the moral paradigm.  The author also concludes that the principle that everyone should receive a minimum of adequate care lacks a concrete affirmative meaning sufficient to guide health care allocations.  However, the absence in the health care context of important negative reasons for refraining from an equal distribution of societal resources supports defining adequate care roughly as the level of health care enjoyed by the middle class.  The author then addresses how to allocate morally a limited budget among the different health care needs of a group.  He rejects arguments that certain health maximization standards are discriminatory or in tension with equity, showing that these arguments generally assume without justification that the status quo is the proper baseline for measuring discrimination.  Upon examination, each maximization standard simply reflects a different baseline of what an equitable distribution of health care would look like.  Although moral analysis provides various useful criteria for making health care tradeoffs within a fixed budget, in the end it cannot dictate any particular measure of group health maximization.  Accordingly, individuals should have a diversity of moral choice by being able to choose--among an array of health plans--the plan that allocates resources according to the policy they prefer.  Finally, the author examines consent-based theories of moral justice and concludes they cannot alone resolve allocation questions.  The reason is that one must go outside the consent-based framework both to determine the timing and conditions for valid actual consent and, where meaningful actual consent is unfeasible, to determine when and to what individuals should be presumed to have consented.  Nonetheless, when coupled with the other propositions derived in this Article, consensual theories can help legitimate binding individuals to their choices among group health maximization policies and can exclude some allocations that we can presume no one would have consented to ex ante.  This Article thus provides a morally and practically tenable framework--grounded in a specific proposal--within which individuals can consent to particular health care allocation schemes.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a dramatically expanding area of activity for managers and academics. Consumer demand for responsibly produced and fair trade goods is swelling, resulting in increased demands for CSR activity and information. Assets under professional management and invested with a social responsibility focus have also grown dramatically over the last 10 years. Investors choosing social responsibility investment strategies require access to information not provided through traditional financial statements and analyses. At the same time, a group of mainstream institutional investors has encouraged a movement to incorporate environmental, social, and governance information into equity analysis, and multi-stakeholder groups have supported enhanced business reporting on these issues. The majority of research in this area has been performed on European and Australian firms. We expand on this literature by exploring the CSR disclosure practices of a size- and industry-stratified sample of 50 publicly traded U.S. firms, performing a content analysis on the complete identifiable public information portfolio provided by these firms during 2004. CSR activity was disclosed by most firms in the sample, and was included in nearly half of public disclosures made during that year by the sample firms. Areas of particular emphasis are community matters, health and safety, diversity and human resources (HR) matters, and environmental programs. The primary venues of disclosure are mass media releases such as corporate websites and press releases, followed closely by disclosures contained in mandatory filings. Consistent with prior research, we identify industry effects in terms of content, emphasis, and reporting format choices. Unlike prior research, we can offer only mixed evidence on the existence of a size effect. The disclosure frequency and emphasis is significantly different for the largest one-fifth of the firms, but no identifiable trends are present within the rest of the sample. There are, however, identifiable size effects with respect to reporting format choice. Use of websites is positively related to firm size, while the use of mandatory filings is negatively related to firm size. Finally, and also consistent with prior literature, we document a generally self-laudatory tone in the content of CSR disclosures for the sample firms.

ID URBAN; PREFERENCES; INEQUITY; JUSTICE; CITIES; HEALTH; SPACE
AB Cities around the world are increasingly developing iconic parks and greenways in historically marginalized neighborhoods to provide social, health, and environmental benefits to their residents. Yet some iconic green space projects trigger increases in housing prices in nearby areas, resulting in the influx of wealthy newcomers and the displacement of the lowest income residents, in a process referred to as environmental gentrification. In this context, park and recreation managers face a dilemma: How should they integrate green spaces in low-income areas when those efforts might ultimately displace the vulnerable residents they are designed to serve?
   To resolve this dilemma, scholars have proposed the concept of "just green enough" to describe sustainability-oriented initiatives that seek to promote green space development while keeping low-income residents in place. Yet we know very little about what this "just green enough" approach means for park and recreation management or how it relates to the three key components of environmental justice (distributional, procedural, and interactional).
   To address this gap, we explore strategies that park and recreation managers are employing to combat environmental gentrification. Using comparative case studies of park projects in Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia, we integrate primary interview and focus group data with information from secondary sources (e.g., recreation management plans, land use plans, housing policies) to search for solutions that can work across a range of diverse contexts.
   We advance the "just green enough" approach by presenting four sets of strategies that park and recreation professionals can use to achieve environmentally just outcomes when working on new or renovated parks in marginalized communities. First, park agencies need to partner with urban planners to establish or preserve a sufficient number of affordable housing units near new or renovated parks. Second, park agencies need to ensure that their leadership staff and on-the-ground employees reflect the ethnoracial diversity of the communities around new or renovated parks. Third, community outreach activities for new or renovated parks should adequately engage people of different races/ethnicities, ages, and incomes, and prepare the most marginalized people to meaningfully participate. Fourth, new and renovated parks and their recreation programs should welcome and engage longtime residents, and not just wealthier newcomers. Together, these strategies outline a more than "just green enough" approach that helps park professionals achieve equitable greening by (1) ensuring marginalized populations get just as much, if not more, access to quality green space as privileged groups, and (2) protecting longtime local residents' ability to stay in place and thrive in the face of gentrification.

AB Aim: To develop a simple health literacy intervention aimed at supporting informed reproductive choice among members of UK communities practising customary consanguineous marriage. Background: The contribution of 'health literacy' to reducing health inequalities and improving primary health-care efficiency is increasingly recognised. Enhancing genetic literacy has received particular attention recently. Consanguineous marriage is customarily practised among some UK minority ethnic communities and carries some increased risk of recessive genetic disorders among off-spring compared with unions among unrelated partners. The need to enhance genetic literacy on this issue has been highlighted, but no national response has ensued. Instead, a range of undocumented local responses are emerging. Important knowledge gaps remain regarding how the development and implementation of culturally appropriate, effective and sustainable responses can be achieved. Methods: Our co-design approach involved active participation by local people. Initial insight generation employed six focus group discussions and 14 individual interviews to describe current understandings and information needs. A total of 11 personas (heuristic narrative portraits of community 'segments') resulted; four participatory workshops provided further understanding of: preferred information channels; feasible information conveyance; and responses to existing materials. Prototype information resources were then developed and feedback gathered via two workshops. Following further refinement, final feedback from healthcare professionals and community members ensured accuracy and appropriateness. Findings: The project demonstrated the utility of co-design for addressing an issue often considered complex and sensitive. With careful planning and orchestration, active participation by diverse community members was achieved. Key learning included: the importance of establishing trusting and respectful relationships; responding to diversity within the community; and engendering a creative and enjoyable experience. The resultant materials were heavily shaped by local involvement. Evaluative work is now needed to assess impacts on knowledge and service uptake. Longer term sustainability will depend on whether innovative community-level work is accompanied by broader strategy including investment in services and professional development.

AB Globally, the present rate of urbanization in mega-urban centers is altering ecosystem functions and resultant ecosystem services of the landscapes. The natural and semi-natural ecosystems within the urban regions are under threat of loss and degradation. Estimating the economic values of the ecosystem services obtained from these natural and semi-natural ecosystems can play an important role in urban policy and decision making. The main objective of this paper is to quantify the changes in ecosystem service values (ESVs) in response to land use land cover (LULC) dynamics and urbanization in the capital city of India, Delhi. Using satellite imageries over the past two decades (1998-2018) we show the estimated changes in ESVs with the global value coefficient (VC) of proximate biomes. The study relies on benefit transfer approach of ESs valuation wherein the ESVs of proximate biomes, derived from one/multiple study site, are used in assessing ESVs at another site. For determining the reliability of the study, a sensitivity analysis is performed to check the effectiveness of VC. The results show a total decline of ecosystem services (ESs) in monetary terms by US$ 7.614 million ha(-1) year(-1) from 1998 to 2018 with prominent changes in LULC. The change analysis shows a loss (US$ 3.6141 million) of regulatory and provisional services. The prominent part (US$ 2.675 million) of this loss was due to decline in city forest cover by 6426.09 ha. The city has benefitted from initiatives in implementation of bio-diversity parks and plantation drives, but also suffers widespread loss of forest over the years. The ESs monitoring at the city administrative divisions (i.e. district-wise) highlights the importance of conservation of natural ecosystems within the urban area with distribution equity. The results provide insights that should be considered for urban planning in order to protect natural resources, ESs, and thus overall well-being of residents.

AB Background Gender inequality within academic medicine and dentistry is a well-recognised issue, but one which is not completely understood in terms of its causes, or interventions to facilitate equality. This systematic review aims to identify, critically appraise, and synthesise the literature on facilitators and barriers to progression through a clinical academic career across medicine and dentistry. It will also explore interventions developed to increase recruitment and retention to clinical academic careers, with a particular focus on gender inequality. Methods The search will cover five databases (MEDLINE (including MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and MEDLINE Daily), Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, and Education Resource Information Center (ERIC)), reference lists, and forward citation searching. We will include studies of doctors, dentists, and/or those with a supervisory role over their careers, with or without an academic career. Outcomes will be study defined, but relate to success rates of joining or continuing within a clinical academic career, including but not limited to success in gaining funding support, proportion of time spent in academic work, and numbers of awards/higher education qualifications, as well as experiences of professionals within the clinical academic pathway. Study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised controlled trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa tool for non-randomised studies, and the QARI tool for qualitative studies. Detailed plans for screening, data extraction, and analysis are provided within this protocol. Discussion This systematic review is situated within a larger project evaluating gender inequalities in clinical academic careers. This review will identify and synthetize barriers, facilitators, and interventions addressing gender inequalities in clinical academia. Our findings will increase awareness of inequalities in clinical academic careers through informing clinical academics, regulators and funders of the issues involved, and potential interventions to counteract these. Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Systematic review registration Open Science Framework:

   Hybrid mode; Learning technologies; Blended learning; Business plan
AB The recently released draft South African National Policy on Post-Secondary Education and Training contains the five goals of the White Paper on Higher Education (2001) as threads throughout the plan: Social justice; a single coordinated system, access, quality and diversity, and improved links between education and work. Stellenbosch University (SU) as one of the top residential, research-intensive institutions in South Africa, has a long history of using blended learning opportunities to contribute to these goals of providing expanded access with success.
   SU has taken a strategic decision to further expand its academic offering in a hybrid mode, i.e. a combination of face-to-face and fully online learning opportunities. Students meet with learning facilitators for block contact sessions (e.g. a week) in a physical learning space, which can be geographically distributed beyond the University's current campuses. A large part of the learning, however, is delivered online via digitally archived learning material and interactive sessions between students and learning facilitators as well as peer interaction. Assessments could be a combination of invigilated tests/exams in distributed assessment centres and online assessments.
   Strong emphasis is placed not only on the reach of the programmes, but also the richness, i.e. enhancing learning and the student experience. Academic transformation as identified by Educause (https://www.educause.edu/eli/initiatives/key-issues-in-teaching-and-learning) as the most important key issue in teaching and learning for 2018, is therefore also a key priority for SU. This includes as indicated by the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative (ELI) survey, "breakthrough teaching and learning models, innovative partnerships and alliances, and strategic transformation of the campus mission." This paper will outline the University's business plan including:
   The conceptual framework of how SU's knowledge offering can be viewed according to two variables: a) whether it is credit bearing and b) whether it is offered on-campus or off-campus.
   How the hybrid mode of offering will be integrated with a comprehensive academic programme renewal initiative.
   Possible markets for the hybrid offering and a special marketing initiatives.
   Mechanisms to ensure that initiatives are scalable and that the students have a positive online experience and adequate support.
   The provision of enough capacity to develop the online offering as well as additional academic, administrative and management staff and strategic partnerships to manage the hybrid offering.
   Three of the six challenges impeding technology adoption in Higher Education identified in the New Media Consortium Horizon Report (http://cdn.nmc.org/media/2017-nmc-horizon-report-he-EN.pdf) are also specifically relevant within the (South) African context, i.e.:
   Improving digital literacy
   Advancing digital equity
   Rethinking the roles of educators.
   The paper will also indicate how these challenges are addressed within the (South) African context as well as how the roll-out of the hybrid offering will be implemented and measured in the short, medium and long term for different credit bearing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and modules as well as non-credit bearing short courses. In conclusion, the paper will also indicate the opportunities for synergy between face-to-face and hybrid offerings that could be beneficial to both the on-and off-campus students.

   South Africa (5th edition)
SO SA JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSESSMENT-CENTER DIMENSIONS; CRITERION-RELATED VALIDITY; EXERCISE
   VARIANCE; METAANALYSIS
AB Orientation: Assessment Centres (ACs) have a long and successful track record in South-Africa when used for selection and development purposes. The popularity of the approach is mainly attributable to the ACs' numerous strengths, which include the perceived fairness, practical utility and strong associations with on-the-job performance. To maintain the integrity of the AC, it is important for practitioners and decision makers to apply the method in a consistent and standardised manner.
   Research purpose: The purpose of the report is to provide practitioners and decision makers with practical guidelines and concrete procedures when using ACs as part of the organisation's human resource management strategy.
   Motivation for the study: The past decade has seen significant advances in the science and practice of ACs. Now in its fifth edition, the revised Guidelines seek to provide important information to practitioners and decision makers on a number of factors when used in conjunction with the AC method, namely, technology, validation, legislation, ethics and culture.
   Main findings: The Guidelines provide specific suggestions and recommendations for using technology as part of the manner of delivery. Issues of culture, diversity and representation are-also discussed. New features of the Guidelines include more concrete guidance on how to conduct a validation study as well as unpacking several ethical dilemmas that practitioners may encounter. Of critical importance is a position statement on the use of ACs in relation to-new legislation (Employment Equity Amendment Act, Section 8, clause d) pertaining to psychometric testing.
   Practical/managerial implications: The Guidelines serve as a benchmark of best practice for practitioners and decision makers who intend on, or are currently, using ACs in their organisations.
   Contribution/value-add: In the absence of formal standards governing the use of ACs in South Africa, the Guidelines provide an important step towards establishing standardisation in the use of the AC method. The Guidelines provide (1) guidance to industrial and organisational psychologists, organisational consultants, human resource management specialists, generalists and the Department of Labour, and others designing and conducting ACs; (2) information to managers deciding whether to introduce AC methods; (3) instructions to assessors taking part in the AC; (4) guidance on the use of technology and navigating diverse cultural contexts; and (5) a reference for professionals on best practice considerations in the use of the AC method.

AB This paper confines itself to the description of the profile of a general dentist while outlining where the boundary between specialist and generalist may lie. The profile must reflect the need to recognize that oral health is part of general health. The epidemiological trends and disease variation of a country should inform the profile of the dentist. A particular tension between the provision of oral healthcare in publicly funded and private services may result in dentists practicing dentistry in different ways. However, the curriculum should equip the practitioner for either scenario. A dentist should work to standards appropriate to the needs of the individual and the population within the country's legal and ethical framework. He/she should have communication skills appropriate to ascertain the patient's beliefs and values. A dentist should work within the principles of equity and diversity and have the knowledge and clinical competence for independent general practice, including knowledge of health promotion and prevention. He/she should participate in life-long learning, which should result in a reflective practitioner whose clinical skills reflect the current evidence base, scientific breakthroughs and needs of their patients. Within the 4-5 years of a dental degree it is not possible for a student to achieve proficiency in all areas of dentistry. He/she needs to have the ability to know their own limitations and to access appropriate specialist advice for their patients while taking responsibility for the oral healthcare they provide. The dentist has the role of leader of the oral health team and, in this capacity; he/she is responsible for diagnosis, treatment planning and the quality control of the oral treatment. The dental student on graduation must therefore understand the principles and techniques which enable the dentist to act in this role. He/she should have the abilities to communicate, delegate and collaborate both within the dental team and with other health professionals, to the benefit of the patient. The profile of a dentist should encompass the points raised but will also be based upon competency lists which are published by a variety of countries and organizations. It is important that these lists are dynamic so that they are able to change in light of new evidence and technologies.

DE Comprehensive training; competences; college students
AB This paper is an experience report describing a proposal for continuing education that is implemented through the Integrated Program to Strengthen Academic (PIFA) to strengthen the profile of students in a college education area in a Mexican state public university, the proposal is implemented on a cross to the curriculum without being part of the formal academic structure of the plan.
   This report is for the purpose of sharing the experience describing the objectives, mechanical instrumentation and results at the time.
   The program from its philosophy sees the student as the focus of institutional efforts, considering in turn, as a human being capable, active and collective responsibility for their own learning process, who is served through a flexible educational model, focused on student learning and the approach of competence, with a curriculum that includes both the generation of knowledge gained in research and social service, as an element of relevance to society and retribution, which is complemented by a solid values training and support care services tailored to student needs.
   The essential objective of a comprehensive lifelong learning and higher education is responding to the needs of today's society, related to the quality of vocational training, encouraging educational innovation in terms of making the educational process meets the growing demands of this society. (I. M. Ruiz, 2000).
   The educational model of the institution recognizes education as a strategy for training and updating of individuals, which focuses on linking learning processes with the skills required in professional practice and work, and emphasizes therefore the performance or the performance of the subject in a particular context and with different levels of complexity.
   There are elements that support this program within the mission of the University, particularly when it is established that the institution's mission to promote viable alternatives to the social, economic, political and cultural entity and the country in terms of diversity, equity, respect and sustainability, and thereby contribute to a more just, democratic and respectful of their environment.
   The results of the program to date indicate a good acceptance and gradually increased the number of participants and course offerings, just as students have found a space for training that they themselves constructed from their needs.

   ENLISTMENTS; UNIFORM; FORCES
AB Since the end of the draft in 1973, African Americans have been overrepresented among volunteers for the US Armed Forces.(1) While many commentators have hailed the military as a uniquely egalitarian avenue for social and economic advancement in a society beset with racial inequities, the high participation rate among blacks has periodically led to concerns that they (and more recently, other ethnic minorities such as Hispanics) would disproportionately suffer from casualties in the event of military hostilities.(2) However, after numerous US military engagements since the 1970s, these fears have not been borne out. In fact, African Americans seem less likely to die in combat than their overall representation in uniform would suggest. Taken at face value, the racial composition of US combat casualties stands in stark contrast to the racial pattern of morbidity and mortality in the larger society, where African Americans as a group fare worse than whites on measures such as death rates, infant mortality, and life expectancy.(3)
   It would seem that, as a comparatively disadvantaged group, African Americans in the all-volunteer era have reaped the benefits of military service without unduly bearing its ultimate burdens. However, explanations for the unexpectedly low African American casualty rate have not been rigorously examined. Furthermore, assessing the racial equity of military service based on historical casualty patterns assumes that future combat operations will closely resemble those that have occurred since Vietnam-an assumption that in this new century looks increasingly untenable.
   Extending the work of Martin Binkin and his collaborators,(4) this study argues that the racial composition of combat casualties reflects three factors: the social processes that sort volunteers into various military units and occupational specialties; the mix of units and specialties that participate in military operations; and the battlefield conditions they encounter. Or put another way, given a particular environment within which armed conflict occurs, the probability of any person becoming a casualty is a function of their representation in those units most likely to make hostile contact with enemy forces. Following this, the underrepresentation of African Americans in the units most involved in combat operations since Vietnam may partly explain the disjuncture between their military participation and casualty rates. By extension, the higher propensity of whites to serve in combat capacities could explain their higher-than-expected, post-Vietnam casualty rate. The same may be true of ethnic Hispanics, who are also overrepresented in the combat arms, though their reasons for volunteering for such assignments may differ from those of their non-Hispanic white counterparts.
   The short duration of post-Vietnam US ground combat engagements such as Panama and Somalia-as well as the prominent roles played by special operations and light-infantry units for which blacks are less likely to volunteer(5)-has thus far prevented a rigorous evaluation of such propositions. However, the 2003-2004 conflict in Iraq presents one opportunity to assess the race distribution of US casualties under varying combat conditions. First, compared to other combat engagements since Vietnam, many diverse military units have been operating in Iraq for a relatively long time. Second, the US military experience in Iraq has been, broadly speaking, marked by differing conflict environments. In the relatively brief opening period, coalition ground combat forces (mainly US and British infantry and armor) rapidly penetrated deep into enemy territory and carried out offensive actions primarily against Iraqi military forces. The subsequent-and ongoing-mission involves efforts by combat and noncombat personnel (e.g., intelligence, police, logistical, and civil affairs) to consolidate US control, restore civil order, pacify hostile forces, and administer occupied areas.
   This study assesses the racial equity of military service by examining the racial distribution of US casualties in Iraq for the first twelve months national dialogue on the equity of military service may shift back to the social process that impels whites-particularly those from the lower socioeconomic strata-into the ranks. However, should US troops resume large-scale offensive campaigns against a number of seerningly growing and increasingly well-organized insurgent threats, casualties among blacks and Hispanics may creep up to a point where the fairness of military sacrifice again becomes an uncomfortable racial issue.
   On a final note, the findings of this study are not germane only to the military experiences of the United States. As of 2000, several advanced industrial democracies with long histories of conscription had abandoned the practice in favor of voluntary service, or had plans to phase it out by 2004. (36) Some nations with rising immigration rates have experienced increased racial and ethnic diversity in their volunteer militaries,(37) while others (such as Spain and France) actively recruit foreign volunteers. At the same time, conflicts such as Kosovo in 1999 and contemporary operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have subjected the militaries of many nations to their first hostile fire in decades (for example, coalition casualties in Iraq include personnel from Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, and Bulgaria). To the degree that ethnic enlistment patterns are similarly structured by socioeconomic factors, debates about military equity and recruitment policies in the US case may presage similar dialogues elsewhere.

TI The relevance of social audit for Oxfam GB
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT International Conference on Social and Ethical, Accounting, Auditing and
   Reporting
CY SEP, 1997
CL NIJENRODE UNIV, BREUKELEN, NETHERLANDS

AB This paper examines what social auditing has to offer Oxfam and similar organisations involved in the collection of charitable donations for international development and relief operations in terms of improving the quality of their work, increasing their accountability to stakeholders, and their capacity to achieve impact in terms of their institutional goals. In looking at the particular case of Oxfam, it discusses issues in relation to the establishment of social auditing with relevance for similar organisations.
   The paper points out that since Oxfam is not a profit-making organisation, but one based on a humanitarian impulse, there are many ways in which it already lives up to the ideals of social audit. The paper lists areas of governance and systems where Oxfam is currently responding to the major principles of social audit, and some of the issues encountered in doing so. These principles have been defined by Zadek (1997) as follows:
   Inclusivity, Comparability, Completeness, Evolutionary, Systems Integration (Embeddedness), External Verification, Communication and Continuous Improvement.
   Each principle is examined to see what it offers Oxfam in terms of its principal concern - to improve the quality and impact of its work, and legitimacy, and what difficulties their application entail. The main aspects lacking at present are:
   a) a systematic consultation with stakeholders
   b) independent verification
   c) the publication of results
   To some extent, Oxfam's Trustees perform the second function, together with external consultants employed to carry out evaluations of its international development programme. The organisation's Annual Review provides public information regarding its work. Nevertheless, the wider publication of negative results, except to the professional and academic audience reached through such publications as "Development in Practice", would certainly be new to Oxfam, as would the setting up of interagency standards or benchmarks.
   The paper argues that rather than adopting social audit as a new cycle, a costly and time-consuming exercise, ways should be sought to ensure existing systems live up to its principles. Even this could become costly, and ways of doing this in a cost-effective manner need to be developed.
   The other major issue for Oxfam is the enormity and diversity of its major stakeholders, ie those people it tries to benefit by means of its international development programme, and the contradictions which exist within them as a group, let alone between them and the other stakeholders of the organisation. Ways in which this could be overcome are suggested, such as consulting them within the remits set by organisational strategic plans, and continually developing greater clarity with regard to the kind of assistance the organisations offers, and taking decisions regarding the weighting to be given to different groups.
   The issue of the publication of negative results in ways which reach the general public is more difficult. It could be resolved by careful decision-making regarding and management of the context in which information is disclosed. It is conceivable that the organisation would gain in its reputation by being seen to be honest even in the most difficult cases, and conversely lose if it were discovered to be hiding negative information. It is already relatively open at the professional and academic level, but needs to consider carefully if it is too cautious in relation to the general public.

AB Purpose This paper aims to reintroduce to proponents of natural disaster readiness worldwide the history and content of the most renowned tsunami mitigation tale in Japan, "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") for the purpose of reconnecting with its many virtues that have made it a cross-cultural pedagogical catalyst for tsunami preparedness education. At a time in the planet's history when global warming mitigation and pandemic advertence in a milieu in which equity, diversity and human rights are highly valued, the insights it contains pertaining to tsunami preparedness, plot design and the politics of its popularity make it particularly instructive. Design/methodology/approach The study used methods, approaches and techniques prevalent in cultural anthropology, i.e. primary texts, historical analysis, linguistic natural hazard preparedness education theory and ethnographic insights to assess how and why "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") has come to be used so broadly on an international scale as a tsunami preparedness teaching tool and the politics involved in this process. Findings The study revealed that the cross-cultural relevance of "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") is related to its unique authorship and development which has cultivated in it three qualities highly compatible with effective disaster mitigation at the international level. These are the simplicity of its message, the practical advice it dispenses and the universally agreeable morality it supports. However, the way in which the Japanese Government has promoted this story does not effectively encourage equity, diversity, or a respect for human rights as a major facilitator of preparedness among the many nations like itself in the region and in the world that are vulnerable to natural hazards. Research limitations/implications The main limitations of the study are that it is based on a historic investigation of the origins of "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") using materials in English and Japanese, a genealogical interpretation of the story using approaches prevalent in translation studies and a qualitative analysis of historical uses of the story, all of which are difficult to quantify. Since the study seeks to find social and cultural patterns in the relevant material presented, the analysis reflects a subjectivity common in all social scientific studies of this kind. Practical implications Educating its readers about tsunami preparedness is one of the most important functions of this paper. The study confirms that "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") provides Japanese and non-Japanese alike with the opportunity to envision and construct a customized culturally specific sense of tsunami readiness by harnessing this dynamic. For Japanese, the story provides a chance to contemplate an astute view of Japanese-style tsunami management from the viewpoint of an outsider who became a well-respected citizen. For non-Japanese, the story offers an opportunity to be reflexive about tsunami readiness based on a cross-culturally adaptable template that Hamaguchi's protagonist Gohei provides. Social implications Pedagogically speaking, "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") makes the most sense when regarded as a starting point for preparing for any natural disaster anywhere.
   The story reminds us that the most educational, globally relevant tsunami preparedness narratives are those that complement and extend the latest of what the world knows about these destructive ocean waves to keep vulnerable citizens safe and alive. This study reveals that as important as the story is the politics of its delivery to provide the best first line of defense against tsunami amnesia which in Japan and many other countries has historically taken far too many lives. Originality/value The paper argues that "Inamura no Hi" ("The Rice Bale Fire") is an example of a tsunami preparedness story that contains a variety of insights that continue to contribute to tsunami awareness education cross culturally that must not be underestimated. However, the way it is currently promoted by the Japanese Government needs to be improved, so that more representatives from more countries involved in tsunami preparedness and natural hazard readiness worldwide can benefit. These are insights not accessible by a researcher who is not bilingual in English and Japanese; thus, by using an ethnographic approach and participant observation utilizing both languages as part of long-term fieldwork, the researcher can gain these insights.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to test the extent to which company-specific attributes including market capitalisation, capital structure and investment focus impact upon the performance of European listed real estate companies. Enhanced understanding of firm-level performance drivers is important for investors in order to diversify their investment portfolios and to mitigate company-specific risks at different points in the real estate cycle. Design/methodology/approach The study centres on six key listed European real estate markets selected on the basis of market capitalisation, diversity, transparency and maturity. A series of statistical tests are undertaken using EPRA and Bloomberg data for the period of 2007-2017 using 113 listed property companies, all of whom were contemporaneous constituents of EPRA indices in this period. A series of customised performance indices were constructed to evaluate firm-level performance attributes. Findings Firm-level attributes collectively account for more variation of risk-adjusted return than sector-level attributes over the investigation period. The impact of firm-specific attributes on performance varies significantly from country to country attributable to the contrasting cyclical property market trends in the pre- and post-Global Financial Crisis period. REITs outperformed non-REITs on a risk-adjusted basis attributed to the strong performance of "niche" market entrants allied with stronger regulatory structure. Finally, the findings showcase that sector specialist firms outperform diversified companies inferring that investors should seek to attain diversification through portfolio-based approaches rather than firm-level strategies. Practical implications The results have implications for real estate companies aiming to raise capital internally for growth as higher return on equity in general signals reduced cost of capital. Secondly, the findings should be of practical use to multinationals specialising in international real estate trading in designing their business plans in general and formulating cross-country investment strategies in particular. Last but not least, a more refined conceptualisation of corporate-level performance drivers should complement existing professional practices in relation to business/company appraisal. Originality/value The research integrates EPRA and Bloomberg data sets to create a series of bespoke index constructs to measure the impact of firm-specific attributes on European listed real estate companies. Additionally, the authors construct a Herfindahl Index (H.I.) to further the debate on the impacts of diversification within the listed real estate sector. This serves to further heighten investor understanding of investment allocation and portfolio optimisation strategies for the listed real estate sector given the increasingly diverse range of investment opportunities within emerging sub-markets.

AB Education for learners with learning needs that can be regarded as challenging has changed over the past 30 years from education in separate school and classroom settings, especially for learners with disabilities based on a medical-deficit model, to education based on the internationally accepted belief that every learner has the right to be included in a mainstream classroom and school. This change flowed from a socially constructed view that stumbling blocks in society play an important role in discriminating against those who are regarded as being different. International organisations such as the United Nations and its agency UNESCO have played and are still playing a leading role in this regard. The publication in 1994 of the Salamanca Statement by UNESCO (signed by 92 countries, including South Africa) is regarded as a watershed event in establishing inclusive education as the guiding principle in the development of equitable education for all; the Statement argues that all learners should be accommodated in mainstream schools regardless of, for example, their physical, intellectual or emotional needs and differences or their home language. High-income countries with well-funded, well-established school systems were quick to follow this movement in developing policies and implementation strategies based on international guidelines. Lower-income countries were slower to follow the new approach and in many instances have simply tried to transfer strategies developed in high-resource countries to their own contexts.
   The focus of this article is to examine critically the implementation of inclusive education in South Africa against the background of international guidelines and efforts by UNESCO to monitor progress.
   Elements of education systems that are regarded as essential for the implementation of inclusive education and that were monitored for UNESCO's 2020 Global Education Monitoring Report on Inclusion in 2018 are placed within Bronfenbrenner's social-ecological model, in which the interaction between processes at different system levels is emphasised. These elements include laws and policies at national or macro-level, governance and finance at national and provincial levels (macro- and meso-levels), school curricula (macro- and meso-levels), facilities and infrastructure within schools and their communities (micro-levels).
   The development of inclusive education in South Africa should be seen as a logical outcome of the introduction of full democracy in the country in 1994 and the concomitant expectation that education would be transformed to recognise the rights of all to be educated. As a result, policy development in education, including policy on the development of inclusive education, took human rights as its point of departure, but it soon became apparent that the idealism expressed in policy documents was difficult to realise in practice. In analysing the implementation of inclusive education in South Africa in preparation for the international monitoring process, the following became clear.
   In the national legal framework, White Paper 6 (2001) is regarded as the point of departure to address inclusive education, the implementation of which is based on the South African Constitution (Republic of South Africa, 1996a) and supports inclusive education for learners with diverse learning needs. However, despite the fact that the White Paper acknowledges a socially constructed view of barriers to learning in an inclusive education system, researchers indicate that recommendations regarding implementation tend to be idealistic and that realities regarding available capacities and resources were not fully taken into account. Furthermore, a strong dependence on the medical-deficit model in the recommendations for learner support by advocating a continuum of support has led to both conflict and ambiguity in the understanding of what inclusive education really means among the members of the general public, teachers, learners and their parents. In connection with governance and finances, UNESCO regards the roles of intersectoral collaborative leadership and adequate funding as crucial. Although South African implementation guidelines since 2001 emphasise the roles of collaboration and participatory leadership, there is insufficient research-based evidence that indicates effective collaboration between different role players and effective leadership regarding the implementation of inclusive education in most schools. Furthermore, budgetary constraints at all system levels continue to have a negative effect on the implementation of inclusive education. This situation involves, inter alia, disparities, especially in rural areas, in the provision of adequate learning material in order to facilitate a more inclusive curriculum, inadequate physical facilities and a lack of effective learning support from district learning support teams, which lead to negative perceptions among teachers of their self-efficacy in implementing inclusive education. Teachers are regarded as key role players and teacher education for inclusion therefore forms an integral part of implementation strategies both globally and in South Africa. An analysis of the contents of initial teacher education programmes in South Africa indicates that an additional model approach is taken when a separate course on inclusive education is added to the programme as a whole, with the result that inclusive education is still regarded as "special" and "separate" and not an essential part of the knowledge and skills that every teacher should acquire. With specific reference to attitudes towards diversity, it is globally accepted that a society's attitudes towards diversity have an important effect on the implementation of inclusive education at macro-, meso- and micro-levels, and South African legal frameworks as well as implementation guidelines therefore stress its importance. However, these attitudes at meso- and micro-levels are affected by both the socio-economic contexts in communities and culturally relevant attitudes towards formal education, especially for learners with disabilities, in specific communities. It is therefore important to note that inclusivity in communities and education is a cultural product that has specific implications, depending on the community concerned.
   The discussion of internationally accepted elements of inclusive education systems and how they have developed in South Africa illustrates the importance of acknowledging the complexities involved in monitoring progress in unique national contexts. It is clear that insight into and knowledge of the dynamic interaction between unique cultural-historical and socioeconomic contexts in national contexts are needed if implementation in a specific national context is analysed. The conclusion is that the time is right to question critically why there is such a strong dependence in South Africa on policies and practices developed in high-income countries. The collaborative development of more locally situated inclusive education approaches at all system levels that draw on the interaction between cultural-historical factors and socio-economic realities in South Africa is imperative if the vision of equitable access to, acceptance of and participation in mainstream education for all learners is to be achieved.

AB The architect has always been interested in the social and cultural dimensions while creating architecture for people to last, with the help of building science and technology. Science could solve some problems, but is yet to solve many of the problems of urbanization in human history. Perhaps many of the problems can only be solved with careful understanding of human behavior, social intercourse, and economics in relation to the urban environments and organizations, and the natural environment simultaneously.
   There seemed to be a divide between the way an engineer and an architect think and practice in making a building and a piece of architecture, where the former is highly mathematical, and the latter deals with cultural poetics and a whole range of social and technical issues of which the physics of the environment is but one dimension (Bay and Ong 2006). It may appear natural in this age of environmental crisis and rapid urban development in many cities that the current Ecologically Sustainable Design (ESD) system, which is mainly based on science of the physical world, would be readily accepted by the architect in practice and education.
   Many of the current ESD guidelines can contribute to the avoidance of a further decay of the earth, thus preventing droughts and floods, etc., and hope to maintain the status quo of the environment for all the "business as usual" social-economic activities. With more world leaders of the developed world agreeing in principle on the need to address climate change, perhaps a lot more will be done based on the engineering models for ecologically friendly planning, commerce, industry, and design. There could be a cognitive bias(3) of overconfidence and systemic error that the predominantly engineering focus to keep climate change at bay will solve the problem of sustainability in various parts of the world. The current limited concept of "ecological" or the "green" design does contribute to sustainability, but is quite limited and not the whole picture of sustainability.
   The concept of sustainability involves the dynamic and complex balance of environmental (man-made and natural), economic and social dimensions, from many earlier sources including the theory of the Third Ecology (Chermayeff and Tzonis 1971) about social ecology directly related to the man-made urban fabric, and recently, the much accepted pervasive framework of the Brundtland Commission Report 1987: Our Common Future, which included more discussions about the interrelatedness with economic equity and the natural environment. Foremost and ultimately it is about promoting and ensuring social quality of living now and sustaining that into the future, for all nations, the rich and the poor, through solving the matrix of social, economic, and environmental problems.
   From the perspective of the theory and practice of architecture, this paper discusses the following issues:
   1. Belief in science, disenchantment, symbol of failure of modern architecture - Pruitt Igoe;
   2. An anti-thesis to Pruitt Igoe - Bedok Court;
   3. The cultural concerns and preparametric design thinking process of the architect;
   4. Architecture, social science, cultural value, social capital, behavior, and ESD;
   5. A Fourth Ecology, multi-disciplinary research by architects, social scientists, and engineers.

AB The article offers an overview of language policy review at the University of the Free State (UFS), from the inception of the university council's 2003 language policy up to the adoption of an entirely new policy in March 2016. This overview is undertaken against the background of theoretical insights about the role of the evaluation of effective policy implementation in policy review at higher education institutions. Several studies as well as some institutional reports since then have suggested that the UFS language policy needed to be reconsidered in view of drastically changing demographics in particular The underlying question that is considered in terms of relevant documentation available in the public space is therefore why the UFS did not respond earlier to warnings about the inappropriateness of a policy that had been implemented under completely different conditions back in 2003. Departing from international studies on policy review, the study specifically looks at the role of regulative factors in policy review. This is done in terms of an analysis of external core reports that, as far back as 2006 already, recorded shortcomings requiring corrective actions by the UFS. The role of specifically two reports published during 2008, namely the Higher Education Quality Committee (HEQC) institutional audit report and the Ministerial Committee's report on transformation and social cohesion and the elimination of discrimination in public higher education institutions (the so-called Soudien report), are considered. Incidentally, they are also foregrounded in a transformation report issued by the UFS towards the end of 2014, which turns out to have provided a basis for reinventing language problems that could eventually be used as a rationale for changing the UFS language policy.
   As these reports have identified a range of shortcomings in the 2003 language policy, the study was specifically interested in how the mentioned transformation report presented these findings and how the UFS responded aspects the transformation report omits. From publicly available documents, it is clear that the UFS has indeed responded appropriately and even revised aspects of implementing the existing language policy. With the changeover to a new leadership during 2009, these measures were not followed through and not even mentioned at all after 2010. Among others, the study finds that the UFS nevertheless did attempt language policy revisions in 2010 and 2012, which led to instilling a more pragmatic approach to language policy implementation. After the 2010 review, the notion was adopted of a university that (still) used English and Afrikaans as media of instruction, but not necessarily within a framework of absolute parallel-medium teaching and where English was used as a kind of mediating language within multicultural situations. Other policies were revised to reflect this new approach, among them the policy on the UFS's branding identity, employment equity and integration in hostels. After the 2012 revision, the notion was adopted that parallel-medium education will be offered where possible and practicable and that the use of Southern Sotho within the teaching and learning environment will be increased. These measures partly responded to the dwindling number of Afrikaans students that still opted for Afrikaans classes (by 2012 already below 30% of all students). The changes resulting from these two reviews notably went further than the corrective actions undertaken before 2010 under the former management. They were nevertheless not mentioned in the UFS's transformation report, nor did they feature in the 2015 review process.
   In order to reconstruct the entire 2015 language review process (which is the actual focus of the study), the run-up to the surprising announcement about a language policy review is studied in some detail. Neither the 2014 annual institutional report nor the UFS's 2015-2020 strategic plan (finalised towards the end of 2014) mentions any of the kind of concerns about the institutional language policy that were raised during 2015. On the contrary, this strategic plan in particular still reaffirms the status quo position regarding language. One therefore has to assume that consistent pressure from the Department of Higher Education and Training by means of the mechanisms envisaged by the 2008 Soudien report, the role of the Director of the UFS's Institute for Reconciliation and Social Justice and the increased demand for transformation from student quarters as a by-product of the #RhodesMustFall campaign, have all contributed to a change of heart by the university management regarding the language issue. In stark contrast with the position adopted towards the end of 2014, it was subsequently argued that the 2003 language policy was found to be inappropriate to promote "transformation at the institution", a phrase that began to be propagated in official announcements and press releases.
   The article concludes that, because of a degree of neglect to execute actual language policy revisions (and thereby aligning revisions made in other policies) the university's management was eventually caught off guard by increased demands for transformation from all quarters. By inadvertently creating a hostile intellectual climate about the position of Afrikaans, the leadership could probably succeed without any policy revision to remove the existing bilingual language policy and replace it with a predominantly monolingual language policy. One therefore wonders whether Afrikaans became the culprit for the lack of proper and regular evaluation of a range of measures that were implemented at different stages in an attempt to realign the 2003 language policy with the changing circumstances at the UFS. In the end, this case demonstrates the importance of a meta-policy that helps to steer a university such as the UFS through troubled waters within an overall unstable higher education environment.

   practices; solidarity
AB But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics. For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be called an 'applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice. A contrasting 'relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency, interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful. It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice. I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand, care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.
   I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention, attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould observes concerning solidarity on this score: 'the proliferation of solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences, along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret Urban Walker has called the 'expressive-collaborative' model of morality over the 'theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power. Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness and embodied living in the natural, material world.
   Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going, contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning this contest, we should 'see the process as basic and never ending, and [subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than [imagine] that it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However, when these patterns endure they comprise 'practices', which may be defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this definition more fully. First, social practices are structured sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power, distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value. Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped, and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact together.
   A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually constructed or 'theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at 'the root of the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of what has been called 'interpretive phenomenology' and has been well developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change, transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal ellipsis The ethos embedded in [interpretive] phenomenology is respect for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices, skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices allow for the other to be encountered and made visible.
   When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it, this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism, reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive, discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty. The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a critique of what she calls 'conventional solidarity', and defines a counter-notion of 'reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. 'Conscience just isn't enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role in them,' he writes. 'Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that could secure moral results that challenge one's standing.
   ' Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all. Thus Kolers defines solidarity as 'reason-driven political action on other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction between agency and the institutional structures within which agency takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and practices of community, but who crucially brings community and solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what might be called 'comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy, one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members.
   In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense, two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity between its members. 'Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time. It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting, defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; it makes perfect sense to talk about being in solidarity with friends and acquaintances. Moreover, the other need not be a human individual: one can stand up for other species, an ecosystem, or a cultural way of life. What is crucial is that there is some kind of power or knowledge differential between self and other in a relationship of solidarity and some kind of injustice or danger impinging upon the life of the other. This kind of solidarity can advocate for improved treatment or benefits for an oppressed or vulnerable group, but does not necessarily challenge the underlying basis for their subordinate social status. Yet, if it does not undermine structural inequalities, standing up for solidarity can perpetuate subordination rather than achieve equality.Standing up with. Solidarity as standing up with takes another step in the recognition of moral standing. Moving from the standpoint for to the standpoint with requires deeper engagement with the experience and lifeworld of the other.
   The difference created by the specificity of lifeworlds nonetheless resides within an overarching interpretive commonality, namely, the ability to understand lifeworlds other than one's own. Without such understanding, others cannot truly be treated with respect, they can only be tolerated, benignly neglected, not interfered with. This closer understanding can tend to humanize and personalize the relationship further, and the potential benefit becomes more reciprocal. Those who stand with others may find their own initial prejudgments concerning others transformed by the encounter. Those who practice solidarity must open themselves to the opportunity-and risk-it poses. Relating to other people or groups in the specificity of their values and vocabularies of self-interpretation can simultaneously develop respect for the specific standpoints of others. It can also enable a greater capacity for intercultural and transpersonal interpretive understanding broadly within a democratic political culture and way of life.Standing up as. The third standpoint is solidarity as standing up as. Obviously this suggests a yet stronger degree of identification between the providers of solidaristic support and the recipients of such support. The solidarity of standing up as involves finding a kind of covering connection that does not negate diversity among individuals at all, but rather establishes the grounds of its respect, protection, and perpetuation. To move through the trajectory of solidarity is to move in the direction of greater imaginative creativity and range in the moral life. Standing up for depends upon a kind of abstract moral commitment to support the application of general norms to the life situation of the other as a being with a certain inherent moral status. It thereby embraces shared moral norms (equal protection of the law, universal human rights), but without necessarily embracing the lived reality and distinct perspectives of the other. Standing up with involves adopting a perspective that is more internal to the lifeworld and the contextually meaningful agency of the other. Standing up as returns to generality, in the sense of a recognition of common humanity, a global or planetary membership, but also moves one imaginatively more deeply into a comprehension of difference and the distinctive individuality of the other. As the moral recognition of the other is altered by this interpretive journey, so is the moral imagination of the self. Arguably a growth in one's capacity to project oneself imaginatively into the perspective and viewpoint of the other person, and a growth in moral awareness or the ability to see connections previously unseen are plausible outcomes of the interpretive transformation effected by the trajectory of solidarity. The practices of solidarity mainly arise in the face of morally aberrant and unjust situations that are stifling human potential and where those being oppressed or suppressed need mobilized support and recognition. What the recipients of solidarity need, and the agents of solidarity provide, is affirmation and tangible support. In contrast, what the recipients of care need, and the agents of care provide, is attention. Though closely related and mutually reinforcing in many ways, solidarity and care are not the same, as affirmation and attention are different stances with different moral significance and developmental potentials. The practices of care are premised on situations that are neither aberrant nor unjust per se but are an inherent part of human species-being.
   Like solidarity, care also deepens the moral imagination of both those who care for others and those who are cared for by others. If focusing on solidarity shifts away from individualism and independence toward mutuality and interdependence, focusing on care shifts away from the individualism of self-reliance to an individuality validated by reliance on others. The practices of care are called forth where a common background condition of potential fragility, vulnerability, insufficiency, and mortality take center stage in the lives of persons in need or trouble and in the lives of those around them. Care offers a universalism that is concrete and thick. It is quite possible to imagine (and to find close empirical approximations of) societies where solidarity is absent. Not so with care. Even the subjugated and impoverished society of the Ik so strikingly (and controversially) described by Colin Turnbull, retained ways of caring for their very young, if not for their very old. They almost, but not quite, lost their cultural concept of care. Care theorists, such as Eva Feder Kittay, point out that universalism is biologically grounded on the necessity of maternal care. Every living human being has in common the fact that once they were cared for by someone (female or male) who took on a mothering role and relationship with them. This commonality extends backward in time. All persons who cared as a mother for a child were able to do so only because mothering had been extended to them by a previous generation. Human society fundamentally depends on the production and reproduction of this structure of care-giving roles and relationships. Equality, Kittay argues, is not based on properties that an individual possesses by virtue of who that individual is, but instead on properties that one possesses by virtue of properties that another person has or once had. In keeping with this, care theorist Joan Tronto also views care as a concrete universal, or a 'species activity' and has proposed that caring: includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our 'world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. This provides yet another reason to distinguish between solidarity and care. Solidarity is based on who the other is as an individual human being and on 'properties' they possess, if by properties we mean something like their moral standing and considerability, their entitlement to dignity and to respect for their human rights. When it comes to care, however, we are dealing not so much with recognition due to persons as with the ongoing, intergenerational, evolutionary web of living that all practices of care at any given moment are a part of. Solidarity is a response that unjustly denied recognition and moral standing calls for. Caring is a response that need calls forth, drawing on cognitive commitments and emotional capabilities that previous practices of caring have made possible. Care, like all the practices that relational bioethics examines and evaluates, should not be defined as good or just in all circumstances and in all its forms. The important work of ethical specification and judgment is skipped over when we equate care with virtues such as agape (selfless love of the other) and caritas (charity), or with social emotions such as other-regarding altruism or sympathy.
   Thus it is important to ask what substantive values should inform caring as a moral practice and its effects. How best to describe the stance and intentionality of caring, its transformative moral psychological effects on agents of care and recipients, and its role in governing structural and institutional power so as to mitigate the tension between social order and social diversity? With these questions in mind, I turn again to construct a developmental moral phenomenology of the practice of care. Before presenting my own account, I should note that Tronto has already offered something akin to what I have in mind. She distinguishes among caring about, taking care of, care giving, and care receiving. Caring about denotes the initial recognition of another's need for care. Taking care of involves assuming responsibility for the determined need of the other and undertaking steps to meet that need. Care giving involves assuming a more direct, physical, and intimate role in the practices of care. Need can be recognized and attended to in many distanced and indirect ways, but giving care is hands-on, physical work. It signifies a new level of commitment and engagement than the other forms the activity of care can take. Finally, care receiving as a distinct component of the practice of care recognizes that the recipient will often be a responsive agent in the care relationship. These distinctions are helpful, particularly in the context of Tronto's concern with the ethically and democratically appropriate institutionalization of the practices of care in a society as a whole. I seek, on the other hand, to explore a structured growth of moral awareness that may be illuminating to ascribe to the praxis of care, as I have tried to do with solidarity. The fundamental stance of the practice of care is to pay attention to. Just as right recognition of personhood and moral standing is fundamental to the solidaristic posture of standing up beside, so too the directed gaze of attention is fundamental to the posture of care. When someone, a student or a distracted friend during a conversation, is called upon to pay attention, their focus shifts and even their bodily orientation may change: they open their eyes, they listen actively, they lean in. Right recognition here comes from becoming visible to another as a sign of acknowledgment and respect. In some cultures and settings, paying attention to someone takes the form of making eye contact as a sign of such respect; in others, deliberately not making eye contact has the same significance. Both are gestures and postures of care. In this sense, the propensity to attend, to care, is not primarily biological or reflexive; it is a mode of culturally meaningful agency, it is a wink rather than a blink. Standing up beside the oppressed-and up against the oppressor-is a gesture that extracts 'payment' in the form of public witness, which can incur negative sanctions or give one an aura of virtue by association. Paying attention to is also not cost-free in terms of its effects on plans in one's life or on other persons, whom the practice of care displaces from one's attention. Solidarity sets priorities, care balances and reshuffles them. Finally, on this account of the moral phenomenology of care, the presence of physical or psychological limitation or impairment is not primarily what calls forth the duty to care, although it is often the trigger for an intensified focus of attention and the commencement of new caring relationships and services.
   The moral raison d'etre of paying attention to is the evil of invisibility, disregard, and abandonment. Willie Loman's wife, Linda, understood this in Death of a Salesman, when she called upon her son to care for his father. 'Attention must be paid.' She was not asking him to help Willie with his medications. The need for care is indeed universal, both biologically and culturally, because it responds to vulnerability, suffering, and mortality. However, being erased and deserted, reduced to bare self-reliance, having to fend for oneself alone-these conditions are neither universal nor inevitable. They are potentials in the human condition that the practice of care was morally and culturally invented to prevent, just as the practice of solidarity was invented to prevent the evil of misprision. And failure to prevent these evils not only diminishes the humanity of those who did not receive attention and recognition, but also diminishes those who failed to give them. There are three distinct postures that agents of care assume toward others in need. No doubt there are many more, but I want to single these out here. I shall call them attentive rehabilitation, attentive companionship, and attentive commitment. These moments in the practices of care are relational interactions between individuals or groups, with each side having voice (to the extent possible) and engaging in a give and take of initiative and response. However, as with my analysis of solidarity, this is presented primarily from the perspective of the agent of care rather than the other receiving care.Attentive rehabilitation of the other. To care is to take steps to rehabilitate or return the other in need to a situation of enhanced living or, as Tronto aptly puts it, repairing the other's world. If return to the status quo ante is impossible, rehabilitative attention becomes a project of helping to construct a new mode of life that will be meaningful and sustainable for the other, who will then go on to live with-and in spite of-social or physical limitations. This is the aspect of care that is perhaps closest to care giving and care provision in a professional sense. It is certainly based on respectful recognition of the moral standing of the patient, but its main hallmark is efficacy in the restoration of function. It is also the aspect of care that is closest in intention to solidarity, for the attention paid here is largely affirming, and the line I have tried to draw between affirmation and attention is blurred. But to probe more deeply into the dimensions of care that have to do with suffering and loss of self and meaning, we need to move beyond restoration and repair.Attentive companionship with and for the other. Companionship is an aspect of care that includes, but is not limited to, physically spending time together and direct communication, as humanly important as they are. Companionship, in the sense I am trying to get at, lays the groundwork for a developing sense of promise, presence, and assurance in the minds and hearts of both the agent of care and the other. Companionship recognizes the evil of abandonment and is one of the most powerful answering responses to this evil on behalf of the human good. It is difficult to say what concept best conveys the aspect of care that can provide this reassurance and abiding sense of connection between and among individuals and groups. Promise connotes perhaps too formal and legalistic a sense. Loyalty connotes something perhaps overly psychological.
   Friendship is tempting but again may suggest an affection or emotional bond that is stronger than I want to convey for this aspect of care.In any case, the reassurance of a promise of non-abandonment is what is built into this mode of attentiveness. Note that this reassurance applies, albeit differently, to both the agent and the recipient of care. My notion is that the suffering experienced by those with unmet needs for care takes place against an ever-present prospect of being left alone. Those young and well often ask to be left alone, not realizing truly what they are inviting, when what they actually want is more privacy and a less intrusive care presence. Caring as attentive companionship makes the grim prospect of abandonment recede in the other's imagination and hence palliates the suffering-often in the form of dread, anxiety, and loss of self-confidence and self-esteem-they experience.To move into a mode of attentive companionship in the care process is clearly a step beyond rehabilitation. What prompts such a step, or better, what is germinated by it? My answer is a new sense of gratitude in the moral imagination of the agent of care. It may be the gratitude felt for the newly arrived life of an infant, and the realization of how vital the assurance of non-abandonment will be to the developmental flourishing of the child. It may be intergenerational gratitude that is reciprocal, as when adult children alter their own lives and priorities to assure companionship to an ailing or lonely parent. It may be a sense of obligation or debt based on remembering the constructive activities of the other, which indirectly has been of significant social and individual benefit to the attentive companion. This is the case, for example, in care-providing institutions that serve military veterans, and this moral sensibility could indeed be extended to all, military and non-military alike, who have sacrificed for the sake of public service. Or it may be itself a form of solidarity at the heart of the practice of care, because it is based on recognition of the human value of rescuing a person from fear and despair to give them a better chance of flourishing in the future.Attentive commitment to the other. This represents a stronger and deeper sense of caring connection, in which the caring agent has internalized a stronger sense of duty and embraced a longer-term, and maybe more arduous, promise to the care recipient. However, the notion of care as attentive commitment to, precisely because it takes in a longer time horizon, can bring out the structural and public policy dimensions of the practice of care, as well. The fact is that individuals and private groups (like families) cannot actually sustain this modality of care without significant social, economic, and institutional support. Part of their commitment would be to work toward building systems of public provision for care services in their role as democratic citizens. Indeed, the politics of social insurance and long-term care policy in the United States would be altered if millions of unpaid family care givers could find the information, time, and energy to mobilize in favor of new financing and service delivery systems.
   To the extent that we want to develop an ecology of care-the creation of a cultural ethos and an institutional framework that promotes and supports practices of care not only in the household and family but also in the public sphere and the civil society-then we must link practices of care to forms of democratic political reform to make society more just, equitable, and conducive to health and well-being. Within the broader political economy and social welfare policy of a nation, paying attention in private life and in public policy-civic care-can reinforce one another. The practice of care can sometimes be imperious and domineering. And all too often caring becomes merely custodial. Yet, when it realizes its full moral promise, care offers nurture, protection, provision, and support for the other. It does not so much domineer as give the person receiving it a new insight about his or her own life. Since the need for care often follows injury, illness, and loss of various kinds, care offers hope through a new way of seeing the positive possibilities present in a given situation. It sustains purpose in the face of diminution. Care among humans is a transaction among individuals who are the authors of their own acts and lives, despite their need, impairment, or limitations. But they are symbiotic, not solipsistic, authors. Like solidarity, care is grounded in the gratitude felt when one recognizes the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life. And like the practice of solidarity, the practice of care interrupts an ongoing form of life in order to be present with another in the face of their need, vulnerability, and suffering, finally winning through to a life well lived. Solidarity and care can arise developmentally out of an engagement with the vocation of repairing a needful, vulnerable, responsive world. The author declares no conflict of interest. Miller, A.

The terminology related to care is more complex and varied, in English, than that related to solidarity. I have chosen to use the term 'care' rather than resort to terms such as caring, care giving, care providing, and the like. When conjoined with the concept of a practice, care should be understood always to connote a dynamic pattern of agency, intention, and action over time. For my purposes in this article, this pattern and its consequences are more important than specific acts performed within practices of care, such as direct physical assistance with activities of everyday living, psychological assistance, ensuring comfort and safety, and the like. Care is touching, but as John Dewey pointed out, it is also minding. See Boydston, J. A. (Ed.). (2008). Art as experience. In The Later Works of John Dewey, 1925-1953 (Vol. 10, p. 68).

   SOLIDARITY AND CARE SOLIDARITY THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF SOLIDARITY CARE THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF CARE CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Many working in bioethics today are engaging in forms of normative interpretation concerning the meaningful contexts of relational agency and institutional structures of power. Using the framework of relational bioethics, this article focuses on two significant social practices that are significant for health policy and public health: the practices of solidarity and the practices of care. The main argument is that the affirming recognition of, and caring attention paid to, persons as moral subjects can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. Solidarity is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from standing up for another, standing up with another, and standing up as another. Care is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from the attentive rehabilitation of another, attentive companionship with and for another, and attentive commitment to another.
